This paper proposes a model for the formation of online purchase intention based on perceived value,
trust and the antecedents of perceived security and privacy, using the model proposed by Ray, Ow, and
Kim (2011) extended to cover third-party assurance seals and related constructs, and examines the inﬂuence on trust of consumers' perceived information quality, privacy, and security. A total of 451 individuals participated in an experiment. The partial least squares technique was applied to data collected
via a questionnaire to test the proposed model. The results indicate that online purchase intention depends on perceived value and trust. The main predictors of perceived trust are perceived information
quality and perceived security. Consumers' perceived security depends on vendor reputation, website
investment, third-party assurance seals, understanding of third-party seals, privacy and security policies,
familiarity with the website, Internet privacy concerns, and disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation.

1. Introduction
The Internet and information communication technology are
leading to great developments in the tourism industry (Buhalis &
Law, 2008). The Internet is ideal for the tourism industry because
of the characteristics of tourism products (McCole, 2002): 1) they
are intangible, 2) their production and consumption cannot be
separated, 3) they are perishable, and 4) they are seasonal. Moreover, the Internet is used in the tourism industry when users search
for information and enter into online transactions (Kim, Chung, &
Lee, 2011). Internet technology allows suppliers of travel products
to sell their products anywhere and at any time (Bernstein & Awe,

1999; Connolly, Olsen, & Moore, 1998; Law & Wong, 2003; Llach,
Mariomon, Alonso-Almeida, & Bernardo, 2013). Online transactions represent a new stage in the tourism industry, which is
working to develop better commercial practices (Kim et al., 2011).
Some of the attributes associated with e-commerce that have
brought about a modiﬁcation of commercial transactions are convenience, economic cost, and product diversity (Yoon, 2002).
Although the number of Internet users has substantially
increased, many users do not make purchases online. They are
reluctant to provide personal information and/or transactional information for electronic payments online because they do not trust
e-commerce (Kim et al., 2011; Kim, Ferrin, & Rao, 2008). A study of
e-commerce showed that more than 87% of users were concerned
about security and privacy protection in online shopping (Ray, Ow,
& Kim, 2011). In addition, the lack of perceived privacy and security
protection is a major reason why many consumers choose not to
shop online; trust therefore plays a relevant role in online transactions (Kim et al., 2011; Wu & Chang, 2005). In this general
context, previous studies have analyzed trust in e-commerce

together with other factors (Cyr, 2008, 2013; Cyr, Kindra, & Dash,
2008; Harris & Goode, 2004; Jin, Park, & Kim, 2007; Kim et al.,
2008; Kim, Xu, & Gupta, 2012; McKnight & Chervany, 2001; Wu,
Hu, & Wu, 2010). Previous research in e-commerce has examined
the antecedents of perceived privacy and/or perceived security (Li,
2014; Lowry et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2011). Ray et al. (2011), besides
studying these antecedents, analyzed the inﬂuence of perceived
privacy and security on consumers' perceived trust in online
transactions.
In the tourism context, trust has also been proved to be one of
the most relevant variables that makes e-business successful in the
travel industry (Kim et al., 2011), the accommodation industry
(speciﬁcally hotels and resorts) (Fam, Foscht, & Collins, 2004), and
the air travel industry, both in general (Kim, Kim, & Shin, 2009) and
for low-cost carriers (LCCs) and in particular (Escobar-Rodríguez &
Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014). Kim et al. (2011) tried to examine the factors inﬂuencing trust (navigation functionality, perceived security,
and transaction cost) and the effect of trust and satisfaction on
loyalty in online shopping for travel products in South Korea.
Escobar-Rodríguez and Carvajal-Trujillo (2014) examined the factors inﬂuencing the intention to use LCC e-commerce websites to
purchase tickets in Spain, analyzing, among other variables, the
inﬂuence of perceived privacy, perceived security, and information
quality on consumer trust in the website. Kim et al. (2009) studied
the determinants of e-commerce on airline e-commerce websites,
on the basis of the technology acceptance model (TAM), and trust
and subjective norms in South Korea.
Few studies in the ﬁeld of tourism and e-commerce analyze the
antecedents of perceived privacy and/or perceived security.
Although studies have examined consumers' perceived value and
purchase intentions (Llach et al., 2013), and their trust and purchase
intentions (Kim et al., 2011), none have examined the effect of
perceived trust on perceived value in the ﬁeld of e-commerce and
tourism. Furthermore, Kim et al. (2011) noted that there is little
research regarding online consumers' perceived trust in travel
products. In this study, we analyze the antecedents of perceived
security and privacy, extending the model proposed by Ray et al.
(2011) by adding a new factor, consumers' perception of thirdparty assurance seals, and two constructs related to this, the
disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation and the understanding
of third-party seals. In addition, using the model proposed by Kim
et al. (2012), we examine the inﬂuence of trust on perceived value,
and the inﬂuence of these two factors on purchase intention.
We have extended the model to include third-party assurance
seals and the related constructs following the recommendations of
€
Ozpolat,
Gao, Jank, and Viswanathan (2013); these authors stated
that there are very few studies examining the role of third-party
mechanisms in helping to increase trust in e-commerce, unlike
the position for the third-party certiﬁcation mechanisms that exist
in ofﬂine settings. Among the few studies that address the issue, Xu,
Teo, Tan, and Agarwal (2010) in the general context, and Lee and
Cranage (2011) in the context of tourism and e-commerce,
concluded that the use of privacy seals, such as TRUSTe, increases
reliability in relation to privacy protection and information
disclosure. Lee and Cranage (2011) analyzed how privacy assurance
and personalization affect both consumers' perceptions of value
and their privacy concerns, in the context of travel websites. They
found that privacy assurance statements and the use of security
symbols increase perceived privacy protection and perceived trust.
In this study, we used the model proposed by Ray et al. (2011)
for three reasons. First, it presents a current integrated framework to study the inﬂuence of signals such as third-party assurance
seals on travel websites and the inﬂuence of different consumer
predispositions on perceived security and privacy protection in
online transactions. Second, Ray et al. (2011) suggest further

287

research to determine whether the personal predispositions
included, but not found to be signiﬁcant, in their model, could inﬂuence perceived security and privacy if they are analyzed together
with other predispositions. Third, Ray et al. indicate the need to
research whether signals from websites inﬂuence online services
other than the general retail websites that they analyze.
With this in mind, this study aims: 1) to examine the inﬂuence
of perceived trust and perceived value on the intention to use ecommerce websites when shopping for travel products; 2) to
analyze the inﬂuence of privacy and security signals and the personal predispositions of consumers on perceived privacy and
perceived security; and 3) to assess the effect of information
quality, perceived security, and perceived privacy on consumer
trust in a website.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next
section, we provide a literature review and propose our working
hypotheses. Following that, we describe the research methodology.
The results are then presented, and ﬁnally we provide our conclusions and the implications for future research.

2. Literature review
2.1. Perceived trust, perceived privacy, perceived security,
information quality, and the relationships between them
Trust in websites plays an important role in e-commerce,
because consumers are unlikely to shop online if they do not trust
the seller's website on which they are shopping (Gefen, 2002;
Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, Saarinen, & Vitale, 1999; Kim et al., 2008,
2011). Studies have analyzed the factors that can inﬂuence consumers' perceived trust, and these help tourism product managers
to design their websites in such a way that consumers perceive the
transactions to be reliable. In this research, we examine, in relation
to travel websites, the antecedents of trust that, according to Kim
et al. (2008), are related to consumers' perceptions, such as security protection, privacy protection, and the quality of the information given on the website. We analyze these factors for travel
websites because only a few previous studies have examined the
antecedents of trust (Escobar-Rodríguez & Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014;
Kim et al., 2008, 2011). Escobar-Rodríguez and Carvajal-Trujillo
(2014) conﬁrm that previous studies have indicated that these
antecedents are very relevant for e-commerce (Au Yeung & Law,
2003; Flavian & Cuinaliu, 2006; Kim et al., 2011; Wong & Law,
2005). In e-commerce, it is difﬁcult to gauge whether online
sellers will meet their commitment to protect the privacy of consumers' personal information (McKnight, Choudhury, & Kacmar,
2002) and/or the security of online transactions (Kim et al.,
2008). Additionally, the content of sellers' websites can affect
consumers' perceived trust (Vila & Kuster, 2011). Hence, it is relevant for online sellers to establish trusted transaction processes so
that consumers place trust in them and consequently form an online purchase intention (Grabosky, 2001).
The deﬁnition of trust is complicated because it is an abstract
and complex factor. The literature gives various deﬁnitions of trust
(Corbitt, Thanasankit, & Yi, 2003; Gefen, Karahanna, & Straub,
2003). In the ﬁeld of e-commerce, according to Pavlou (2003),
trust is the belief that renders consumers vulnerable to the good
faith of online sellers after learning of their characteristics. Gefen
(2000) conceives of trust in a very similar way, as a general belief
in an online seller that results in a behavioral intention. Another
deﬁnition of trust in this context is provided by Kim et al. (2008);
they deﬁne trust as the subjective belief that the online seller will
fulﬁll its transactional obligations, as those obligations are understood by the consumer. In this paper, we use this last deﬁnition.

The information quality antecedent can be conceived as the
consumers' general perception about the completeness and accuracy of the website information concerning both the services offered
and the procedure for carrying out an online purchase transaction
(Kim et al., 2008). Then, depending on the quality of information on
the website, a consumer may perceive that the site is or is not
suitable for making the required online purchase correctly (Kim
et al., 2008). In other words, when various websites contain information about similar products, the factor that induces consumers to
opt for one particular website over the rest to make the required
purchase is the quality of the information that the site is perceived
to provide (Raganathan & Ganapathy, 2002). Thus, the greater
consumers' perception that the website of an online seller contains
high-quality information, the more likely they are to think that the
website of the online seller is trustworthy (Kim et al., 2008).
Regarding the perceived security antecedent, this can be deﬁned
as the perception of consumers that the online seller has included
the antecedents of security, such as veriﬁcation, authentication,
encryption, protection, and non-repudiation (Kim et al., 2008).
Chellappa and Pavlou (2002) noted that if consumers perceive that
the website of the online seller offers security factors such as a
security policy, a safe shopping guarantee, and other protection
mechanisms, they will deduce that the online seller guarantees the
security of an online purchase. Thus, the greater consumers'
perception that the website of an online seller guarantees security
during online transactions, the more likely they are to perceive that
the website of the online seller is trustworthy (Kim et al., 2008).
The perceived privacy protection antecedent can be conceptualized as the probability that the online seller will ensure that the
conﬁdential information about the consumer acquired during the
online transaction is protected against unauthorized disclosure or
use (Kim et al., 2008). During an online transaction, the online
seller requests and collects a large amount of personal information
about the consumer, such as his or her name, home address, phone
number, email address, bank account and credit card details; the
consumer may suspect that the online seller will give or sell this
information to other entities, companies and persons (Kim et al.,
2008). Faced with the possibility of this occurring, the consumer
may decide against purchasing online e the consumer has lacks
conﬁdence that the online seller will properly protect his or her
privacy.
In the ﬁeld of e-commerce, Kim et al. (2008) conﬁrmed the
relationship between information quality, perceived security, and
perceived privacy protection and trust. In the context of tourism and
e-commerce, Escobar-Rodríguez and Carvajal-Trujillo (2014)
examined the effect of information quality, perceived security and
perceived privacy protection on trust. Thus, for travel websites that
sell travel products, information quality, perceived security, and
perceived privacy protection will almost certainly affect consumers'
trust.
Based on the previous evidence, we formulate the following
hypotheses for travel websites:
H01. Consumers' perception of the quality of website information
has a positive effect on trust.
H02. Consumers' perception of website security protection has a
positive effect on trust.

been analyzed in the ﬁeld of tourism. We decided to explore the
antecedents of perceived privacy and perceived security in the
ﬁeld of tourism for travel products, because of the great inﬂuence
of these factors on trust in the sales websites (Kim et al., 2009).
Accordingly, we extend the model proposed by Ray et al. (2011) by
incorporating third-party assurance seals and a couple of related
constructs. Ray et al. (2011), as suggested by Gefen et al. (2003)
and Kim and Benbasat (2003), differentiated the antecedents of
privacy and security in response to the ﬁve sources that confer
trust: 1) a consumer's personality; 2) knowledge based on a consumer's prior experiences; 3) institutional assurances from the
online seller; 4) calculative assurances from the online seller; and
5) cognitive assurances from third parties. These ﬁve sources are
grouped into two broad components: ﬁrst, the consumers' individual predispositions regarding privacy and security signals; and
second, privacy and security signals according to signaling theory
(Table 1).
The ﬁrst component, consumers' personal predispositions, refers to the factors that might predispose users to perceive privacy
and security measures on the website of the online seller. Those
factors are relevant because online sellers use a variety of tools to
adhere to privacy and security standards, some of which are quite
technical and are not always perceptible to consumers, such as
encrypted transmissions, ﬁrewalls, and intrusion detection systems
(Bhimani, 1996; Cavusoglu, Raghunathan, & Cavusoglu, 2009;
Furnell & Karweni, 1999; Ray et al., 2011). Other tools, for
example privacy and security policies, third-party certiﬁcates, and
the emailing of the proof of purchase are implemented during the
interaction with a user (Ray et al., 2011). Within the ﬁrst component, we added to the two variables considered by Ray et al. (2011)
(Internet privacy and security concerns and familiarity with the
travel website), two others (disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation and understanding of third-party assurance seals). The
Internet privacy concerns and disposition towards third-party
certiﬁcation factors represent consumers' personality-based trust
sources, because they refer to a consumer's predisposition to trust
others and believe in their good intentions (Gefen et al., 2003; Ray
et al., 2011). On the other hand, familiarity with the website and
understanding of third-party assurance seals are consumers'
knowledge-based trust sources (Table 1), the former because a
consumer's familiarity with a seller's website reduces uncertainty
(Gefen et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008), and the latter because a
consumer's understanding of the seals displayed on a seller's
website increases his or her trust. Internet privacy concerns refer to
the propensity to be generally concerned about threats to personal
information submitted over the Internet and/or the safety of payments in online transactions (Dinev & Hart, 2006; Malhotra, Kim, &
Agarwal, 2004; Ray et al., 2011; Sheehan & Hoy, 2000; Smith,
Milberg, & Burke, 1996). According to Ray et al. (2011), familiarity

with the website includes the predisposition of consumers to trust
online sellers based on their prior knowledge of those sellers.
The second component proposed by Ray et al. (2011), security/
privacy signals, is based on signaling theory. This theory states that
companies can perform actions and provide cues that give information about quality to customers, whether or not these signals are
credible to and interpretable by the customers (Duncan & Moriarty,
1998; Rao, Qu, & Ruekert, 1999; Ray et al., 2011). Within this
component, they include the factors used by online sellers to increase trust by providing institutional, calculative, and cognitive
assurances (Gefen et al., 2003; Ray et al., 2011) (Table 1). These
signals cannot directly inﬂuence the perceptions of consumers,
because the quality of security and privacy is difﬁcult for consumers
to appreciate (Ray et al., 2011). As noted by Wang, Beatty, and Foxx
(2004), online sellers utilize different strategies to signal their
trustworthiness and to ease consumers' concerns over e-commerce
(Wu et al., 2010). Thus, consumers should rely on indirect cues, or
signals, to assess the level of quality (Ray et al., 2011; Zeithaml,
1988). Ray et al. (2011) included three signals from online sellers
that could affect perceived privacy and security: privacy and security policies, perceived website investment, and the reputation of
the online seller. In our model, we add a fourth signal, third-party
assurance seals. Privacy and security policies are statements provided by online sellers that supply information and claim that
privacy and security are assured (Kim & Benbasat, 2003; Lowry
et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2011). Schlosser, White, and Lloyd (2006)
refer to the website investment made by the online seller in
terms of the effort, time, and money spent on developing it. This
investment signals the importance of security and privacy protection for the online seller, because the physical appearance of
products has always been a signal of quality (Dawar & Parker, 1994;
Ray et al., 2011). Privacy and security policies and website investments are ﬁrst-hand quality information sources about the
€
seller's website, provided directly by the online seller (Ozpolat
et al., 2013). Regarding the reputation of the online seller, Ray
et al. (2011) considered that second-party information on sellers
is a signal of quality, indicating privacy and security protection to
consumers (Duncan & Moriarty, 1998; Gefen et al., 2003). The
reputation of the online seller provides quality information about
the seller's website, and is based on the experience of previous
€
shoppers, that is, a second-party information source (Ozpolat
et al.,
2013).
In accordance with the constructs and relationships of the
model proposed by Ray et al. (2011), as well as the previous evidence, we suggest, in the context of tourism and e-commerce for
travel websites, the following hypotheses regarding consumers'
perceived privacy and security:

289

H11. Perceived website investment positively inﬂuences consumers' perception of website privacy protection.
H12. The online seller's reputation positively inﬂuences consumers' perception of website security protection.
H13. The online seller's reputation positively inﬂuences consumers' perception of website privacy protection.

H06. Familiarity with the seller's website positively inﬂuences
consumers' perception of website security protection.

2.2.1. Third-party assurance seals
Third-party assurance seals (e.g., TRUSTe, VeriSign, BBBOnline)
provide assurance to consumers that a website follows particular
operating practices, that payments are secure, and/or that the
privacy policy indicates what the seller can and cannot do with
personal data collected online (Kim et al., 2008; Kim, Sivasailam, &
€
Rao, 2004; Shapiro, 1987). According to Ozpolat
et al. (2013),
companies that provide assurance seals examine the website's security, privacy, and service quality and, if these meet a number of
quality standards, the seller is allowed to display the assurance seal.
McKnight and Chervany (2001) argue that third-party seals are
sources of trust based on institutional assurances (Table 1) and, as
suggested by Jiang, Jones, and Javie (2008) and Kimery and McCord
(2002a), they might increase consumers' perceived security and
privacy.
A number of studies have analyzed the inﬂuence of third-party
assurance seals on trust, but there is a lack of consensus on this
€
(Ozpolat
et al., 2013). While some studies found a positive inﬂuence
(Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; Jiang et al., 2008; Rifon, LaRose, &
Choi, 2005; Yang, Hung, Sung, & Farn, 2006), others did not (Hui,
Teo, & Lee, 2007; Kim et al., 2008; Kimery & McCord, 2002a;
McKnight, Kacmar, & Choudhury, 2004; Metzger, 2006;
Pennington, Wilcox, & Grover, 2003; Yousafzai, Pallister, & Foxall,
2005). On the other hand, very little is known about the effect of
assurance seals on consumers' perceived security and/or privacy,
except for the results of the studies of Kim and Kim (2011), who
found a positive inﬂuence, and Lowry et al. (2011), who found that
seals fail to increase consumers' perceived privacy. Furthermore, in
the context of tourism and e-commerce, no study has analyzed
either the impact of seals on trust or their impact on consumers'
perceived security and privacy, so our study is the ﬁrst to address
those issues.
If consumers perceive, by means of signals such as third-party
assurance seals, that the online seller provides security and privacy protection in online transactions, their perception of uncertainty and online shopping risks should tend to be reduced (Kim &
Benbasat, 2003; Wu et al., 2010). In fact, seals should contribute to
increasing consumers' privacy protection (Hoffman, Novak, &
Peralta, 1999) and/or security protection (Udo, 2001). Thus, for
online shopping for travel products, if third-party assurance seals
are cues for security and privacy protection on the travel websites
of online sellers, it can be hypothesized that displaying these
assurance seals will positively inﬂuence consumers' perception of
website privacy and security protection. Thus, this study suggests
the following research hypotheses in the context of tourism and ecommerce for travel products:

H07. Familiarity with the seller's website positively inﬂuences
consumers' perception of website privacy protection.

H14. The presence of a third-party assurance seal positively inﬂuences consumers' perception of website privacy protection.

H08. Privacy and security policies positively inﬂuence consumers'
perception of website security protection.

H15. The presence of a third-party assurance seal positively inﬂuences consumers' perception of website security protection.

H04. Internet privacy concern negatively inﬂuences consumers'
perception of website security protection.
H05. Internet privacy concern negatively inﬂuences consumers'
perception of website privacy protection.

H09. Privacy and security policies positively inﬂuence consumers'
perception of website privacy protection.
H10. Perceived website investment positively inﬂuences consumers' perception of website security protection.

2.2.2. Disposition towards third-party certiﬁcates
With this construct, we refer to the disposition to trust thirdparty certiﬁcation such as seals. The disposition to trust is deﬁned
as a consumer personality trait that shows the degree to which

290

n Ponte et al. / Tourism Management 47 (2015) 286e302
E. Bonso

consumers are predisposed to perceive others as trustworthy (Jiang
et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2008). This predisposition of consumers is
based on the result of ongoing lifelong experiences with and
knowledge of a certain trusted party (Kim et al., 2008; McKnight,
Cummings, & Chervany, 1998). Therefore, if a consumer has a
high inclination to trust others in general, this disposition is likely
to have a positive inﬂuence on her or his trust in a particular seller,
and if she or he has a low inclination to trust others in general, she
or he is likely to develop a lower level of trust in a particular seller
(Kim et al., 2008; McKnight et al., 1998). The inﬂuence of the
disposition to trust on trust has been studied in the general literature (Kim et al., 2008; Kimery & McCord, 2002a; Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995; Wu et al., 2010). Jiang et al. (2008) proposed
that the disposition to trust third-party certiﬁcation has an inﬂuence on the perception of the identifying logos for third-party
certiﬁcation, and that this factor has an inﬂuence on online
seller trust. The disposition to trust third-party certiﬁcation is
deﬁned as the tendency to depend on third parties for trustworthy
information during online transactions. If consumers have a high
tendency to trust third-party certiﬁcation, such as security and
privacy protection assurances, this disposition is likely to have a
positive effect on her or his perception of the privacy and security of
the online seller. As noted by Wu et al. (2010), consumers with a
higher disposition to trust are more credulous (Gefen, 2000), and
they are more likely to trust online sellers displaying third-party
assurance seals, increasing their perception of website security
and privacy protection (Wu et al., 2010). Thus, for travel e-commerce websites for the purchase of travel products, consumers'
disposition to trust third-party certiﬁcation will almost certainly
inﬂuence their trust in those websites. In this study, it is hypothesized that security and privacy protection will be related to the
disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation in tourism e-commerce products, as follows:
H16. Consumers' disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation
positively affects their perception of website security protection.
H17. Consumers' disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation
positively affects their perception of website privacy protection.

2.2.3. Understanding of third-party assurance seals
Lowry et al. (2011) suggested that an understanding of thirdparty assurance seals indicates that the consumer knows that his/
her data are protected. Online sellers display third-party assurance
seals on their websites to increase consumers' perception of website security and privacy protection; however, if the consumers do
not understand the seals, it is useless to display them. In fact,
McKnight et al. (2004) and Moores (2005) highlighted the fact that
third-party assurance seals fail because consumers do not understand their forms or function; hence, it is necessary to study consumers' understanding of the seals. This factor was analyzed by
Lowry et al. (2011), who also considered that the use of a thirdparty privacy assurance seal will not be effective if consumers do
not understand it. In the context of tourism and e-commerce, it is
also relevant that consumers understand the seals if they are to be
useful. Given the relevance of the consumers' understanding of the
seals for shopping for travel products, we propose the following
research hypotheses:
H18. Consumers' understanding of third-party assurance seals
positively inﬂuences their perception of website security
protection.
H19. Consumers' understanding of third-party assurance seals
positively inﬂuences their perception of website privacy protection.

2.3. Perceived value, perceived trust, purchase intention, and the
relationships between them
On the basis of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979;
Wang & Wang, 2010), we assume in this research that an overall
judgment of value inﬂuences the online purchase intention. In the
e-commerce context, perceived value can be deﬁned as the consumer's assessment of beneﬁts against costs when shopping with
an online seller (Zeithaml, 1988). Consequently, the perceived
value of a transaction with an online seller is the net beneﬁt (Kim
et al., 2012; Seddon, 1997). Obviously, consumers wish to shop for
products with those vendors who offer maximum value (Kim et al.,
2012; Wang & Wang, 2010; Zeithaml, 1988). In fact, the literature
has shown that the perceived value of a product inﬂuences the
purchase intention (Chang & Wildt, 1994; Dodds, Monroe, &
Grewal, 1991). In the e-commerce context, studies have
conﬁrmed the relationship between perceived value and purchase
intention (Chang & Wang, 2011; Fuentes-Blasco, Gil-Saura,
Berenguer-Contrí, & Moliner-Vel
azquez, 2010; Kim et al., 2012;
Wu, Chen, Chen, & Cheng, 2014). In the tourism e-commerce ﬁeld,
Llach et al. (2013) examined the inﬂuence of perceived value on
intention in the purchasing of airline tickets, concluding that the
effect is signiﬁcant and positive. Thus, this study proposes
the following hypothesis regarding online shopping for travel
products:
H20. Perceived value on a website positively inﬂuences the online
purchase intention.
According to Kim et al. (2012), if consumers have trust in an
online seller, they expend less effort on searching for information
about the online seller and on executing the online transaction.
Perceived trust can decrease the transaction's non-monetary cost;
this cost incorporates variables such as the time and effort
required to choose an online seller (Chiles & McMackin, 1996) and
the perceived risk of online shopping (Jarvenpaa, Tractinsky, &
Vitale, 2000; Kim et al., 2012). As perceived trust reduces the
non-monetary cost, it raises the perceived value when shopping
online on a seller's website (Kim et al., 2012). Only Kim et al.
(2012), in the e-commerce context, have examined the inﬂuence
of perceived trust on perceived value, and they conﬁrmed this
inﬂuence. There is no study examining this relationship in the ﬁeld
of tourism and e-commerce. For our research, for shopping online
for travel products, consumers' perceived trust in travel websites
will reduce the non-monetary cost and this will raise the
perceived value of the online shopping. In our study, we hypothesize that perceived trust has an inﬂuence on perceived value as
follows:
H21. Trust in an online seller positively affects the perceived value
for customers.
In the e-commerce ﬁeld, several previous studies have
conﬁrmed the relationship between trust and the intention to
purchase online (Chiu, Huang, & Hui, 2010; Gefen et al., 2003;
Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; Jarvenpaa et al., 2000; Kim et al.,
2008, 2012). In the ﬁeld of tourism and e-commerce, this relationship has also been analyzed, and the conclusion has been
, Sanz,
reached that the inﬂuence is signiﬁcant and positive (Bigne
s, 2010; Escobar-Rodríguez & Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014;
Ruiz, & Alda
,
Kamarulzaman, 2007; Kim et al., 2009, 2011; Sanz-Blas, Ruiz-Mafe
rez Pe
rez, 2014; Wen, 2009, 2010). Thus, for online shopping
& Pe
for travel products, we hypothesize:
H22. Trust positively affects the online purchase intention.

3. Methodology
3.1. Measurements
A set of measurement items was adapted to the speciﬁc context
of this research, and a total of 55 items was obtained. In Table 2, we
present the complete list of items, which were measured by means
of multi-item scales, for the constructs taken into account in this
research. The responses of the survey participants to each of the
items were measured on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1
(¼ “strongly disagree”) to 7 (¼ “strongly agree”). This is the usual
way of measuring variables that are not directly quantiﬁable or
observed (Churchill & Iacobucci, 2002).
The items in the questionnaire were validated on the basis of the
opinions of a focus group of e-commerce and e-tourism academics
and professionals, who were asked whether the items were
appropriate for the purpose of evaluating e-commerce and trust.
The focus group's opinions led us to modify some items to make the
meanings clearer. A pre-test was carried out on 40 individuals of
different ages and genders, selected by quota and convenience
sampling, who had purchased travel products on a website in the
past year. This ensured that those individuals who had not purchased travel products in the past year were dropped from the pretest. Using the feedback from this pre-test, modiﬁcations were
made to the wording of some items to increase the clarity further,
but these were only minor. A ﬁnal questionnaire was created and
administered to 30 individuals of different genders and ages,
selected by quota and convenience sampling, who had purchased
travel products on a website in the past year. The clarity of the
questionnaire was thus conﬁrmed, and no more changes were
made to it.
The questionnaire was originally drafted in English, but it was
intended for use in Spanish for consumers from Spain who had
experience of purchasing tourism products on websites. Therefore,
the English questionnaire was translated into Spanish by a

291

professional native English translator and by researchers, working
independently. After a careful analysis of the differences between
these independently translated questionnaires, a deﬁnitive version
of the Spanish questionnaire was agreed. This ﬁnal version was
then translated back into English by another native English professional translator to ensure consistency between the English and
the Spanish version of the questionnaire (Brislin, 1970). Table 2
shows the items for this study and the supporting literature for
each construct.
3.2. Sample and data collection
This study used quota and convenience sampling. The convenience sampling method was utilized because the population size
is unknown for this study (San Martín & Herrero, 2012). The quota
sampling method was employed to match the target population
structure in both age and gender (Kim et al., 2009, 2011; San Martín
& Herrero, 2012). To calculate the number of participants that
would be sufﬁcient in each age and gender category, population
data were obtained from the 15th Internet users survey (AIMC,
n para la Investigacio
n
2013), a study carried out by the Asociacio
n (Table 3). Afterwards, to combine the
de Medios de Comunicacio
diverse quotas, convenience sampling was carried out (San Martín
& Herrero, 2012). Males and females are represented as follows:
67.8% and 32.2%, respectively. The age groups constitute the
following: 5.8% aged under 20 years; 13.7% aged 20e24; 31.7% aged
25e34; 36.4% aged 35e44; 8.9% aged 45e54; 3.1% aged 55e64; and
0.4% aged 64 and over. Table 4 shows the data on the gender and
age of the participants. There were more males (67.8%) than females (32.2%). The largest proportion of the respondents (36.4%)
were aged between 35 and 44, followed by those aged between 25
and 34 (31.7%).
The participants were recruited by email among the community
of our university. We emailed an invitation to participate in our
research to current students, alumni, faculty members, and staff,

The data was collected from November 2013 to January 2014 in a
computer room under the supervision of two members of the
research team and one graduate student. From the 489 participants
who were recruited, a total of 451 usable questionnaires were obtained. The characteristics of the participants are very similar to
those of the population (Table 3).

and they were also asked to forward the invitation to their friends
and colleagues. An appointment for the computer lab was given to
the participants who answered our email. Additionally, we invited
people randomly selected outside the university to participate.
Those who agreed to participate were given a pen drive with the
university seal. Ahuja, Gupta, and Raman (2003) found that prior to
a purchase individuals tend to visit one to three websites. Consequently, we replicated the work of Kim et al. (2008) by instructing
respondents to select just two or three travel websites from which
to make a purchase decision. The travel websites used were websites through which travelers can purchase travel products such as
hotel bookings, airline tickets, and transportation reservations. As
in the study conducted by Kim et al. (2011), we excluded cruises.
Following the method of Kim et al. (2008), the participants were
instructed, in the computer room, to go through the online purchasing process up to the clicking of the purchase button (this step
was excluded). After surﬁng the websites, they were randomly
assigned to one of two questionnaires: one questionnaire asked
questions about the website from which the participant was less
inclined to make a purchase; and the other questionnaire asked the
same questions but about the website from which the user was
more inclined to make a purchase. Accordingly, we could ensure
that the purchase intention construct had adequate variance,
because we had data to predict both purchases and non-purchases.
Following Hu, Wu, Wu, and Zhang (2010), we checked that all the
participants followed the instructions given in the computer room
with respect to viewing the websites and clicking each button up to
the purchase button. We excluded questionnaires ﬁlled out in less
than eight minutes because, following Ray et al. (2011), we felt that
the length of the questionnaire meant that this was not possible.

A regression analysis of latent variables is used in this study,
based on the partial least squares (PLS) optimization technique, to
build a model that represents the relationships between the fourteen proposed constructs measured by many items. The PLS is a
multivariate technique to test structural models (Wold, 1985). It
estimates the model parameters that minimize the residual variance of the dependent variables of the whole model (Hsu, Chen, &
Hsieh, 2006), it does not require any parametric conditions (Chin,
1998), it is recommended for small samples (Hulland, 1999), and
it is particularly used for complex models, exploratory studies and
prediction (Henseler, Ringle, & Sinkovics, 2009). It is the preferred
algorithm when the study aim is prediction and theory development (Ayeh, Au, & Law, 2013; Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). This
paper tries to explore the role of third-party assurance seals and
their related constructs as antecedents of trust, and the role of trust
and perceived value in predicting the intention to purchase travel
online. This is the reason we chose the PLS technique.
The data analysis took place through a two-stage methodology,
as suggested by Gerbing and Anderson (1988), in which the ﬁrst
stage was to develop and evaluate the measurement model and the
stage second was to develop the full structural equation model.
4.1. Measurement model evaluation
The ﬁrst step involved establishing the convergent and
discriminate validity of the constructs, and the individual reliability
for each item.
According to Falk and Miller (1992), the convergent validity of
each construct is acceptable for a loading higher than 0.505. The
individual reliability for each item is given by loadings or correlations between the item and the construct. Table 5 indicates the
loadings for each item and the t-values that are signiﬁcant. They all
comply with the required conditions.
To measure the internal coherence of the indicators in relation
to the constructs, the reliability was calculated, and to verify the
reliability of the indicators, DilloneGoldstein’s rho, also referred to
€reskog,
as the composite reliability coefﬁcient (Werts, Linn, & Jo
1974), and the Cronbach alpha coefﬁcient (Cronbach, 1970), were
utilized; these range from 0 (no similarities) to 1 (maximum similarities). Both parameters are taken into account, as the ﬁrst concerns the respective indicators while the second assumes the
contribution made by each indicator to be similar. Table 6 represents the values of each coefﬁcient. The composite reliabilities are
above the minimum acceptable limit of 0.70 (Gefen, Straub, &
Boudreau, 2000; Nunnally, 1978). The Cronbach alpha coefﬁcient
levels are also shown in Table 6. They are all above 0.70, which is
recommended for conﬁrmatory research (Churchill, 1979).
Convergent validity indicates the common variance between
the indicators and their construct. To evaluate this validity, as
suggested by Fornell and Larcker's (1981), each construct's average
variance extracted (AVE) was calculated; the acceptable threshold
should be higher than 0.50. Table 6 represents the AVE scores
achieved for each of the fourteen constructs employed, which in all
cases surpass the minimum desirable value.
In order to conﬁrm the discriminant validity among the constructs, the square root of the AVE must be superior to the

been proved to be one of the most relevant variables inﬂuencing ecommerce in the ﬁeld of tourism (Escobar-Rodríguez & CarvajalTrujillo, 2014; Fam et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2009).
Regarding e-commerce in tourism, few studies have analyzed
trust in online shopping (Kim et al., 2011) and its antecedents, and
no study has analyzed the antecedents of perceived privacy and/or
perceived security or the effect of perceived trust on perceived
value. To ﬁll this gap, we propose a model of the formation of online
purchase intention based on perceived value and the antecedents
of perceived privacy and security from Ray et al. (2011) and
extended to third-party assurance seals and related constructs,
such as disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation and the understanding of seals. Our model also examines the inﬂuence of
consumers' perceived information quality, privacy and security on
trust. In particular, this research includes all the antecedents of
perceived security and privacy, except technological innovativeness, and security and privacy signals such as privacy/security
policy, perceived website investment, and vendor reputation, and
personal predispositions towards them, such as Internet privacy
concern and familiarity with the website. These antecedents are
extended by incorporating consumers' perception of third-party
assurance seals (signal), their disposition towards third-party
certiﬁcation, their understanding of third-party seals (predispositions), the inﬂuence on perceived trust of perceived privacy,
perceived security, and information quality, and, ﬁnally, the effect
of perceived trust and perceived value on the intention to purchase
travel online.

values). This is also an indication of the convergent and discriminate validity of the measurement.
Following the establishment of the individual reliability of each
item and the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs, the structural model was examined.
4.2. Structural model
A PLS analysis was performed to test H1 through H22. The
regression parameters are based on the bootstrapping of 100
samples and not on a sample estimator. This facilitates the
computation of the student t-test for each hypothesis, and the
vy, Valenciano, & Michal, 2009). The
generalization of the results (Le
results represented in Fig. 2 and Table 9 indicate the relationship
between the different constructs. According to Falk and Miller
(1992), since all the r-squares are higher than 0.10 the predictive
capability of the model is satisfactory.

5.1. Academic implications
The results of this study reveal an advance in research on
tourism and technology. The main contribution of the study to the
literature is the evidence it provides on the effect of assurance on
trust antecedents in consumers' intention to purchase travel online.
This is a topic that has not been researched by academics in the
context of tourism and e-commerce in the past. This paper represents a step forward in research on how consumers' personal
predispositions and security and privacy signals affect their intention to purchase travel online. Additionally, this is one of the ﬁrst
studies to analyze, in the context of e-commerce and tourism, the
inﬂuence of third-party assurance seals and two related constructs,
the disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation and the understanding of privacy seals. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the
factors that inﬂuence consumers' perceived trust in travel websites

5. Conclusions
Online transactions represent a new stage for the tourism industry, which is working to develop better commercial practices
(Kim et al., 2011). Consumers are shopping online (Kim et al., 2011),
but, although the number of Internet users has increased, many
users do not buy online: they are reluctant to provide personal
information and/or transactional information for electronic payments online because they do not trust e-commerce (Kim et al.,
2008, 2011). The lack of perceived privacy and security protection

once the perceived security and privacy of the website are known.
Finally, this is one of the ﬁrst studies to analyze the effect of consumers' perceived trust on the perceived value of online travel
purchases.
Our ﬁndings indicate that the main predictors for consumers'
perceived privacy, in order of relevance, are: Internet privacy concerns; vendor reputation; and website investment. Consumers'
perceived privacy depends on the levels of their general concerns
about Internet privacy, the provider's reputation, and the consumers' perception of the investment made in the travel website.
On the other hand, there is no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of third-party
assurance seals, familiarity with the website, understanding of
third-party seals, disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation, or
privacy and security policies on consumers' perceived privacy.

Secondly, the empirical evidence of this study suggests that the
main predictors of consumers' perceived security, in order of
impact, are: vendor reputation; website investment; third-party
assurance seals; understanding of third-party seals; privacy and
security policy; familiarity with the website; Internet privacy
concerns; and disposition to third-party certiﬁcation. Thus, based
on these ﬁndings, consumers' perceived security of websites for
shopping for travel depends on eight variables: the provider's
reputation, the consumers' perceived investment in the website,
the display of third-party assurance seals on the website, the understanding of the seals, the privacy and security policies available,
consumers' familiarity with the provider or prior knowledge of the
provider, the levels of general concerns about Internet privacy, and
the general disposition to trust the perception of third-party

certiﬁcation. Thirdly, the ﬁndings indicate that the antecedents of
consumers' perceived trust, in order of impact, are information
quality and perceived security. Thus, consumers' perceived trust
depends on the perception of the quality of the information on the
website and the security measures that they perceive on the travel
website. By contrast, the hypothesis of the inﬂuence of consumers'
perceived privacy on consumers' perceived trust was not proved.
Fourth, the empirical evidence of this research suggests that the

main drivers of the intention to purchase travel online are, in order
of relevance, perceived value and trust. Lastly, consumers'
perceived trust inﬂuences the perceived value of their online
shopping.
Vendor reputation is the strongest predictor of consumers'
perceived security in travel purchase websites. On the basis of this
ﬁnding, the higher the vendor's reputation, the more likely consumers are to perceive the travel website to be secure. This ﬁnding is

consistent with previous studies (Ray et al., 2011). In our study,
vendor reputation is also a relevant predictor of consumers' perceived
privacy. This means that the higher the vendor's reputation, the more
likely consumers are to perceive that the website protects their privacy; hence, this also leads to the suggestion that website managers
should manage their online vendor reputation carefully. This result is
consistent with previous studies (Ray et al., 2011).
Website investment is a factor that plays a relevant role as a
driver of perceived security and privacy protection. This is consistent with the results of Ray et al. (2011), which suggested that
website investment was the strongest predictor. This means that the
technical standard of a travel website, and consumers' perception
that the online seller has invested effort, time, and money in it
(Schlosser et al., 2006), inﬂuence both perceived security and
perceived privacy. Consequently, it is recommended that online
sellers invest time, effort, and money in the design of their shopping
websites, so that consumers perceive that security and privacy are
protected. However, in this study, website investment had a much
higher effect on perceived security than it had on perceived privacy.
The results indicate that third-party assurance seals on the
travel shopping websites inﬂuence consumers' perceived security.
However, contrary to the relationship that we hypothesized, they
do not inﬂuence consumers' perceptions of privacy protection.
Thus, consumers perceive that third-party assurance seals protect
their security but not their privacy. This may be because consumers
do not understand what these seals mean, and believe that the
seals only protect their online security. Regarding the lack of inﬂuence of assurance seals on consumers' perceptions of privacy
protection, no consensus has been reached, and our results are
consistent with Lowry et al. (2011), although Kim and Kim (2011)
found them to have an inﬂuence. As this is the ﬁrst study to
analyze the effect of assurance seals on consumers' perception of
security, we cannot compare our results with the previous literature. The closest research, referring to contexts other than tourism,
concerned the inﬂuence of assurance seals on consumers'
perceived trust, and while some studies reported a positive inﬂuence (Jiang et al., 2008; Rifon et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006), others
did not (Kim et al., 2008; McKnight et al., 2004).
Consumers' understanding of third-party assurance seals is a
variable that plays a relevant role as a direct driver of their
perceived security on online shopping websites. This means that
the greater the understanding of assurance seals, the greater consumers' perceived security protection when shopping on those
websites. As this is the ﬁrst piece of research to study the inﬂuence
of an understanding of assurance seals on consumers' perceived
security, we cannot compare our results with the previous literature. We suggest that web managers should ensure consumers'
understanding of seals, because that implies a broader perception
of security protection in the online shopping processes. On the
other hand, the understanding of seals is found not to inﬂuence
consumers' perceived privacy protection. This result coincides with
those of Lowry et al. (2011).
Regarding the inﬂuence of privacy and security policies displayed on travel websites, this factor is a predictor of consumers'
perceived security on those websites. This means that when this
signal, a privacy and security policy, is displayed, consumers
perceive that the travel website protects their security. However,
privacy and security policies displayed on websites for travel
shopping are not a predictor of consumers' perceived privacy. Thus,
that signal does not affect consumers' perceived privacy protection.
This result partially coincides with that of Ray et al. (2011), who
conﬁrmed the effect of a privacy and security policy on both consumers' perceived privacy and consumers' perceived security.
The website familiarity factor affects consumers' perceived security in online shopping for travel. However, it does not inﬂuence

consumers' perceived privacy. This means that consumers' prior
knowledge of the online seller of travel increases their perceived
security protection but does not inﬂuence their perceived privacy
protection. These ﬁndings partially coincide with those of Ray et al.
(2011), who could not conﬁrm the direct inﬂuence of website familiarity on consumers' perceived privacy and security.
The Internet privacy concerns factor inﬂuences consumers'
perceived security and privacy in online shopping for travel. This
means that consumers' predisposition to believe that there are
risks related to personal information and payments decreases their
perceived privacy protection in online shopping for travel products
and decreases their perceived security protection in online shopping. These results are not consistent with the results of Ray et al.
(2011), who could not conﬁrm the direct effect of Internet privacy
concerns on consumers' perceived privacy and security.
With respect to the disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation
factor, this, in contrast to our expectations, does not exert a positive
inﬂuence on perceived security protection, and, of even greater
importance, appears to have a negative effect. This surprising
ﬁnding may reﬂect the fact that consumers with higher levels of
disposition to trust in third-party certiﬁcation might already
perceive a lack of security in travel websites. On the other hand,
consumers with lower levels of disposition to trust in third-party
certiﬁcation tend to perceive higher initial security in a travel
website because they think that travel websites implement security
measures to protect them. Finally, the disposition towards thirdparty certiﬁcation has a smaller impact on the perceived security
protection than the inﬂuence of the other determinant factors that
we consider.
In our research, contrary to the relationship hypothesized, the
disposition to trust in third-party certiﬁcation does not affect
consumers' perceived privacy protection. An explanation for the
lack of an effect of the disposition to trust in third-party certiﬁcation on privacy in online shopping for travel is that other, more
relevant, antecedent factors of the perception of privacy, such as
vendor reputation, website investment and Internet privacy concerns, have displaced much of the effect of the disposition towards
third-party certiﬁcation on perceived privacy. Thus, we believe that
in the presence of stronger cues, disposition towards third-party
certiﬁcation becomes less relevant in inﬂuencing consumers'
perceived privacy. This is the ﬁrst paper to study the inﬂuence of
the disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation on consumers'
perceived security and privacy, and we cannot compare our results
with any previous studies. In ﬁelds other than tourism, the closest
study cannot demonstrate the direct effect of consumers' disposition to trust on their perceived trust (Wu et al., 2010).
In this research, the results suggest that the main antecedents of
trust that are related to consumers' perceptions are, in order of
relevance, information quality and perceived security. Thus, consumers' perceived trust depends on the perceived quality of the
information on the travel websites and their perceived security.
This means that the greater the consumers' perception of the
quality of information offered and their perceived security on the
travel website, the greater will be the perceived trust in that
website. However, we were surprised to ﬁnd that consumers'
perceived privacy is not a predictor of perceived trust: the relationship hypothesized is not signiﬁcant. Thus, consumers'
perceived privacy protection in e-commerce and tourism does not
imply greater perceived trust in the travel website. Thus, consumers have perceived trust in travel websites because of the
perceived information quality and the perceived security, but not
because of their perceived privacy on the websites. The information
quality is the strongest predictor of consumer trust. This coincides
with the results of previous studies (Escobar-Rodríguez & CarvajalTrujillo, 2014; Kim et al., 2008; Liao, Palvia, & Lin, 2006; McKnight

n Ponte et al. / Tourism Management 47 (2015) 286e302
E. Bonso

et al., 1998). Consumers' perceived security is also a predictor of
consumer trust, and this is consistent with the results of previous
studies (Escobar-Rodríguez & Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014; Kim et al.,
2008, 2011; Yousafzai et al., 2005).
Based on the results of this research, the predictors of online
purchase intention in the context of e-commerce and travel, in
order of relevance, are perceived value and trust. Perceived value is
the main antecedent of online purchase intention, and this means
that the greater the perceived value to consumers of items on the
travel website, the more likely they are to have the intention to
shop on that website. Kim et al. (2012) also found that perceived
value is an antecedent of online purchase intention, although not
that it is the principal antecedent. Trust is a predictor of the online
purchase intention for e-commerce and travel. This means that the
greater consumers' perceived trust in travel websites, the stronger
their intention to use them. This result is consistent with those of
previous studies (Kim et al., 2009, 2011; Sanz-Blas et al., 2014; Wen,
2010). In this research, also, trust is found to be an antecedent of
perceived value. Thus, the greater consumers' perceived trust, the
greater the perceived value that consumers may obtain by shopping on the travel website.
In this study, the model proposed by Ray et al. (2011) has been
extended to explain consumers' perceived privacy and security,
trust, perceived value, and purchase intention in relation to ecommerce and travel. This paper extends the model of Ray et al.
(2011) by adding third-party assurance seals and two related constructs, the disposition towards third-party certiﬁcation and the
understanding of third-party seals.
5.2. Managerial implications
The results of this research have relevant practical implications
for marketing practitioners and managers who design strategic
plans and implement tools to improve the performance of online
travel shopping. On the one hand, the knowledge of the antecedents of perceived security and the inﬂuence of these factors on trust
is useful for managers who should develop strategies and actions
aimed at increasing the perceived security protection of their
websites and, consequently, the trust in these websites. On the
other hand, as information quality inﬂuences trust, actions can be
taken by managers to increase information quality. On the basis of
the results of this research, perceived value is the main antecedent
of online purchase intention for travel products, and so it is recommended that the managers of travel websites direct their marketing strategies towards creating and maintaining consumers'
maximal perceived value in the online transactions. This is the
single largest action that managers can take to ensure that more
consumers have a stronger online purchase intention. The results of
this study also suggest that tourism marketers can inﬂuence the
perceived value of online shopping, and hence the online travel
purchase intention, if they are able to increase consumers'
perceived trust in their websites.
Since many consumers are still reluctant to buy travel products
online because of their distrust of travel websites, tourism managers should be aware of the importance of improving the level of
consumers' trust. We found that information quality is the main
predictor of trust, and thus, to improve the level of perceived trust,
tourism managers should increase the quality of the information
provided on their websites. For this reason, travel websites should
provide up-to-date and accurate information regarding both travel
products (e.g., timetables, availability, prices, conditions, etc.) and
the online transaction process. The decision-making process for
consumers requires them to scan, collect, ﬁlter, integrate, and
compare information about travel products, but this process is
time-consuming and important (Liao et al., 2006). If a travel e-

299

commerce website cannot offer complete and accurate information, consumers may perceive that it is not suitable for completing a
travel purchase online. Thus the information provided on the
website should be accurate, clear, timely, and sufﬁcient in terms of
depth of content, should describe the characteristics of the travel
product and should be free of technical terms. For example, to increase consumers' perception about the timeliness and accuracy of
information, the travel website can include a time stamp for the
information (Kuan, Bock, & Vathanophas, 2008).
Our results indicate that to improve the level of perceived trust,
tourism managers should try to improve the level of consumers'
perceived security on their websites. The ﬁndings suggest that
vendor reputation is the strongest predictor of consumers'
perceived security for travel shopping websites. It is recommended
that web managers of online shopping sites take care to manage
their online vendor reputation to ensure that it is high, because it is
a quality signal that is very relevant for increasing consumers'
perceived security. We suggest that tourism managers should
manage the word-of-mouth communication in social networks and
recommendation websites to maintain and increase their reputation. Given that website investment is another relevant antecedent
of perceived security in online transactions for travel products, it is
fundamental that tourism managers invest time, effort, and money
in the design of their online shopping websites so that consumers
perceive that their security is protected. Online sellers should pay
attention to the design and build of the travel website, since website investment inﬂuences consumers' perceived security. Another
relevant implication for tourism managers is related to the role of
third-party assurance seals. From our ﬁndings, the consumer perceives that an online seller provides security in online transactions
for travel products if a third-party assurance seal is displayed on the
travel website. It is recommended that travel websites should
display third-party assurance seals because this increases consumers' perceived security. Communications by assurance seal
companies can enhance consumer beliefs in these seals. It is relevant to indicate that there is a need to inform consumers about the
functions of third-party assurance seals, because if the consumers
do not understand them they are useless. To facilitate the understanding of the seals, tourism managers should encourage consumers, by text instructions or visual cues, to click on the thirdparty assurance seal and ﬁnd an explanation of the seal (Kimery
& McCord, 2002b). We agree with Kimery and McCord (2002b)
that these explanations by assurance seal companies should be
well-written and simple, to make them easier to understand. We
found in this study that the privacy and security policies displayed
on travel websites are a predictor of consumers' perceived security
in online transactions on these websites. An implication for tourism
managers is that travel websites should display and clearly explain
these privacy and security policies, which are signals for increasing
consumers' perceived security. We also recommend, if privacy and
security policies are to be useful, that they do not contain descriptions that are too lengthy, because consumers do not wish to
spend time and effort reading them (Kim & Kim, 2011), and that
they do not incorporate technical words that are hard for consumers to understand (Kim & Kim, 2011). It is possible that the
provision of privacy and security policies in video format can increase consumers' perception of security protection (Lee, Au, &
Law, 2013). Given that consumers' perceived security is inﬂuenced by their familiarity with the travel website, it is fundamental
for tourism managers to ensure that consumers have knowledge of
the online seller, and have an understanding of how to search for
information and how to carry out an online transaction through the
travel website. This knowledge arises from consumers' prior
experience of the process of purchasing from travel websites. It is
recommended that travel companies implement communication

300

n Ponte et al. / Tourism Management 47 (2015) 286e302
E. Bonso

strategies on the Internet and/or other traditional media so that
consumers can increase their knowledge and understanding about
using travel websites for shopping online. This would have the effect that more consumers would perceive a stronger security protection in online transactions for travel products. Additionally, an
easy purchasing process for travel websites should make it a good
experience and, consequently, cause consumers to become familiar
with the travel website.
The inﬂuence of the personality characteristics of consumers in
Spain on their perceived security, such as their propensity to be
concerned about threats to personal information and/or safety in
payments for online transactions, and the degree to which they are
predisposed to depend on third parties for trustworthy information
during online transactions (Jiang et al., 2008), offer practical implications for tourism managers. It is suggested that, in Spain, travel
websites should deliver speciﬁc actions for each segment of consumers, according to the degree of their concerns about privacy and
their disposition towards third-party certiﬁcates. It is recommended that websites are designed to capture distinctions in
consumers' concerns about privacy and disposition to trust, and
then dynamically adapt their information according to the consumer segment. Also, for consumers who show high Internet privacy concerns, tourism managers should inform consumers and
ensure that they can easily check the type of information available
and know that they can delete or modify that information
(Malhotra et al., 2004).
5.3. Future research
Finally, we propose some ideas for future work in relation to the
formation of perceived security and privacy, trust, perceived value,
and online purchase intention. It would be interesting to replicate
this research for different speciﬁc travel products, to reach more
insightful conclusions. This study is cross-sectional, that is, it
measures the variables at a single point in time; future studies
should therefore examine the validity of the proposed model by a
longitudinal analysis. It would also be of interest to replicate this
research in different countries and to examine the possible crosscultural differences. Another future research line is to include
other variables, such as user experience with the Internet, user
experience of purchasing tourism products, consumer personality
traits, the inﬂuence of price on perceived value, and sociodemographic characteristics.
