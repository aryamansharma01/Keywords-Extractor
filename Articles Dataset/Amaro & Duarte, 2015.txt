Grounded in the Theory of Reasoned Action, the Theory of Planned Behaviour, the Technology Acceptance Model and on the Innovation Diffusions Theory, this study proposes and empirically tests an integrated model to explore which factors affect intentions to purchase travel online. Partial Least Squares
Structural Equation Modelling was conducted to assess the hypotheses. The empirical results, obtained in
a sample of 1732 Internet users, indicate that intentions to purchase travel online are mostly determined
by attitude, compatibility and perceived risk. The theoretical contributions of this study and the practical
implications are discussed and future research directions are detailed.

1. Introduction
Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been
changing the tourism industry ever since the 1980s (Buhalis & Law,
2008), playing a central role in its growth and development
(Gretzel & Fesenmaier, 2009). In fact, the establishment of the
Computer Reservations Systems and Global Distribution Systems
(Sabre, Amadeus, Galileo, and Worldspan) in the 1980s transformed
the tourism industry dramatically. During the late 1980s and early
1990s, these systems were important elements for distributing
tourism products, with the advantage of providing information
about customers (Gretzel & Fesenmaier, 2009). However, it was the

development of the Internet in the 1990s that brought the great
transformation and unprecedented opportunities to the tourism
industry, changing this industry and travellers' behaviour in several
ways (Buhalis, 1998; Gretzel & Fesenmaier, 2009).
One of the most signiﬁcant transformations was that the
Internet represented a new and potentially powerful communication and distribution channel for travel suppliers (Law, Leung, &
Wong, 2004; Morrison, Jing, O'Leary, & Cai, 2001), fulﬁlling the
gap between consumers and suppliers (Buhalis, 1998). For decades,
airlines, cruise lines, the lodging sector and the rental car industry
had been heavily dependent on travel intermediates (e.g. travel
agents) to disseminate information and sell their products and
services. With a new distribution channel, these travel suppliers
found a way to bypass intermediaries and reach customers directly,
while saving money (Zhou, 2004). For consumers, the emergence of
the electronic market brought lower prices, discounts and time
savings (Heung, 2003). In the second half of the 1990s, the

S. Amaro, P. Duarte / Tourism Management 46 (2015) 64e79

emergence of online travel agencies, such as Expedia (http://www.
expedia.com) and Priceline (http://www.priceline.com) revolutionised the way travel was purchased.
The Internet is now an important distribution channel for travel
(Lee & Morrison, 2010), generating a worldwide revenue over 340
billion United States dollars (USD) in 2011. Worldwide online travel
sales have grown 10% each year between 2010 and 2012 and predictions until 2016 show that worldwide online travel sales will
continue to grow at 8% yearly (eMarketer, 2012).
Given the importance of online travel shopping, the growing
body of literature is not surprising. Yet, in a review of articles
published in 57 tourism and hospitality research journals from
2005 to 2007, Law, Leung, and Buhalis (2009) noted that the
number of studies related to consumers was relatively small as
compared to the other two categories considered in their study,
namely technological development and suppliers. Similarly, after
analysing information technology in the hospitality industry
research published between January 2003 and July 2004 in 12
hospitality and tourism journals, O'Connor and Murphy (2004)
found that “consumer research is largely absent but desperately
needed” (p.481). Therefore, the authors suggested themes for
further research, such as what motivates consumers to use a certain
distribution channel and also what motivates them to buy travel
online. On the other hand, as Amaro and Duarte (2013) point out,
research addressing online travel shopping presents contradictory
results and is typically fragmented. The ﬁndings of these studies
support the signiﬁcance of the current study.
Therefore, this research adopts a distinctive approach to analyse
the determinants of intentions to purchase travel online, by proposing and empirically testing an integrated model, with contributions from well-grounded theories, namely the Theory of
Reasoned Action (TRA) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), the Theory of
Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, 1991), the Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM) (Davis, 1985, 1989) and the Innovations Diffusion
Theory (IDT) (Rogers, 1995), contributing to the current literature
since, to the best of knowledge, this has not been done in any other
study.
These theories have received substantial empirical support in
explaining users' acceptance in several domains, notably information systems, and speciﬁcally online shopping (e.g. George, 2004;
Limayem, Khalifa, & Frini, 2000; Pavlou & Fygenson, 2006; Shim,
Eastlick, Lotz, & Warrington, 2001; Yu & Wu, 2007). The proposed model seeks to take advantage of the validity, parsimony and
reliability that these theories provide as determinants of behaviour,
adding other constructs in order to improve explanatory and predictive power. Indeed, besides the constructs derived from these
theories, trust and perceived risk were added to the model, since
researchers have pointed out that their roles in the context of online travelling shopping are still unclear (Kim, Chung, & Lee, 2011;
Lin, Jones, & Westwood, 2009).
With this integrative approach, it will be possible to determine
not only which variables signiﬁcantly affect intentions to purchase
travel online, but also the ones that have the strongest impacts,
enhancing our understanding of online travel shopping. Additionally, the model considers the multidimensionality of two constructs
(perceived relative advantages and perceived behavioural control),
for a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that inﬂuence the purchase of travel online.
The ﬁndings will help online travel providers to better understand travellers' online behaviour. Knowing the driving
forces that determine travellers' intentions to purchase travel
online is paramount for the successful implementation of online
marketing strategies (Lee, Qu, & Kim, 2007) and to convert
potential customers to actual ones and retain them (Limayem
et al., 2000).

2. Literature review
2.1. Intentions to purchase travel online
Intentions to purchase travel online is the main dependent
variable of the model, derived from the TRA, that posits that
behavioural intentions, rather than attitudes, are the main predictors of actual behaviour (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). It is assumed
that intentions capture the motivational factors that inﬂuence
behaviour and the stronger the intention to engage in behaviour,
the more likely should be its performance (Ajzen, 1991).
Behavioural intentions have been well-established as a strong
predictor of actual usage of information technologies (e.g. Davis,
Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis,
2003) and of online shopping (e.g. Ajzen, 2011; Limayem et al.,
2000; Lin, 2007; Pavlou & Fygenson, 2006). Furthermore, in
voluntary settings, as in the case of online travel shopping, intention to behave has been postulated as the best predictor of
behaviour (Moital, Vaughan, & Edwards, 2009).
2.2. Attitude towards online travel shopping
According to the TRA, intentions are the result of attitudes towards the outcomes of behaviour (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). In
Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) seminal work, the researchers discuss
the confusion and ambiguity surrounding the attitude concept,
namely because of the wide range of existing deﬁnitions and measures. However, there seems to be a widespread agreement that
affect, deﬁned as a person's feelings towards an object, person, issue
or event, is the most essential part of the attitude concept (Fishbein
& Ajzen, 1975). According to Fishbein and Ajzen (1975), attitude is a
“learned predisposition to respond in a consistently favourable or
unfavourable manner with respect to a given object” (p.15).
It is expected that positive attitudes will lead to higher intentions to perform the behaviour. Following Fishbein and Ajzen's
(1975) deﬁnition, in this study attitude is deﬁned as the strength
of a person's feeling of favourableness or unfavourableness towards
the purchase of travel online.
In the travel context, several studies have evidenced that attitude towards online shopping positively inﬂuences intentions to
, Sanz, Ruiz, & Alda
s, 2010; Lee et al.,
purchase travel online (Bigne
2007; Morosan & Jeong, 2008). Additionally, among the variables
 et al. (2010) included in their study, attitude had the stronBigne
gest effect on intentions to purchase travel online.
Therefore, as intention is determined by the person's positive or
negative attitudes towards the decision, it is expected that:
H1: Individuals' attitude towards online travel shopping positively inﬂuences intentions to purchase travel online.

2.3. Communicability
According to the TRA a person's behavioural intention is not only
a function of attitude towards the behaviour, but also of subjective
norm, described as the person's perceptions of the social pressures
to perform the behaviour (Ajzen, 1985; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975). As a
general rule, if individuals believe that their referents think they
should perform the behaviour, than they will perceive social
pressure to do so (Ajzen, 1985).
While subjective norm may explain intentions to perform
certain behaviours, several authors have also evidenced that subjective norm was neither signiﬁcant in predicting intentions to
purchase online (e.g. Lin, 2007; Pavlou & Fygenson, 2006; Wang,
Chen, Chang, & Yang, 2007) nor actual online purchases (e.g.

66

S. Amaro, P. Duarte / Tourism Management 46 (2015) 64e79

George, 2004). More recently, a study in the context of online travel
shopping evidenced that social inﬂuence did not affect online
purchase intentions (San Martín & Herrero, 2012). Venkatesh and
Davis (2000) argue that subjective norm only has an effect on intentions in mandatory usage contexts, and not when the usage is
voluntary. However, it is undeniable that the most pervasive factors
that inﬂuence an individual's behaviour is the inﬂuence of others
(Burnkrant & Cousineau, 1975). Therefore, due to the importance of
considering the inﬂuence of others and since prior work has found
that subjective norm has not performed well in explaining intentions to purchase online, this study suggests employing
communicability, a different form of social inﬂuence. Communicability is related to the inﬂuence of family and friends, in the sense
that people are more likely to book online and to frequently book
travel online if they know that other people are doing likewise
(Morrison et al., 2001). Yet, there is no general consensus on this
matter. Indeed, Li and Buhalis (2006) asserted that communicability was not important in explaining the adoption of online travel
shopping. To further explore this inconsistency the following hypothesis is formulated:
H2: Communicability positively inﬂuences intentions to purchase travel online.
Kim, Qu, and Kim (2009) also found that the recommendation of
family and friends was important to reduce the risk perceived with
online travel purchases. Thus, knowing that families and friends
purchase online can relieve customer's anxiety in purchasing online
and reduces perceived risk (Corbitt, Thanasankit, & Yi, 2003), it is
proposed that:
H3: Communicability negatively inﬂuences perceived risk of
intentions to purchase travel online.

2.4. Perceived complexity
The Innovations Diffusion Theory (IDT), originally developed by
Everett Rogers in 1962, is one of the most frequently used theories
to explain technological innovation (Hung, Yang, Yang, & Chuang,
2011). According to Rogers (1995), ﬁve innovation characteristics
e Perceived Complexity, Perceived Compatibility, Perceived Relative Advantages, Trialability and Observability2 e will determine if
adoption or diffusion will occur.
Perceived complexity reﬂects the extent in which it is difﬁcult to
understand and, consequently, to use (Rogers, 1995). As one can
expect, innovations that are simpler to understand will be adopted
more rapidly than innovations that require new skills (Rogers,
1995). For the purpose of this study, perceived complexity is the
degree to which purchasing travel online is perceived to be difﬁcult.
The measurement scales and deﬁnition of complexity is
considerably similar to TAM's perceived ease of use (Venkatesh
et al., 2003). Several researchers have highlighted these similarities (Davis, 1989; Moore & Benbasat, 1991; Wu & Wang, 2005).
Common sense and theory suggest that innovative technologies
that are perceived to be easier to use and less complex have a
higher possibility of acceptance and use by potential users (Davis
et al., 1989; Shih & Fang, 2004). Therefore, the TAM posits that
ease of use is a determinant of attitude (Davis, 1989). In the travel
context, studies grounded on the TAM have found that perceived
ease of use affected consumer's attitude towards online travel

Only Perceived Complexity, Perceived Compatibility and Perceived Relative
Advantages were included in this study, as only these were found to be consistently
related to adoption (Tornatzky & Klein, 1982).

agencies (Cho & Agrusa, 2006) and on attitude towards using hotel
reservation websites (Morosan & Jeong, 2008).
Based on these ﬁndings and on the TAM, it is expected that the
perceived complexity of online travel shopping will be a determinant of attitude towards online shopping. Thus:
H4: Individuals' perceived complexity of online travel shopping
will be negatively related to attitude towards online travel
shopping.

2.5. Perceived compatibility
Perceived compatibility is a construct borrowed from the IDT
deﬁned as “the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being
consistent with existing values, past experiences, and needs of
potential adopters” (Rogers, 1995, p. 15). Based on Vijayasarathy's
(2004) deﬁnition of compatibility applied to online shopping, for
the purpose of the current study, compatibility is the extent to
which consumers believe that purchasing travel online ﬁts/
matches their lifestyle, needs, and shopping preference.
Research has supported the positive and signiﬁcant relationship
between compatibility and attitude towards online shopping (e.g.
Chen, Gillenson, & Sherrell, 2002; Vijayasarathy, 2004). Bellman,
Lohse, and Johnson (1999) reported that individuals who spent a
considerable amount of time using the Internet and other related
technologies such as e-mail in their job or personal life would be
more likely to shop online. Christou and Kassianidis (2003) and Li
and Buhalis (2006) also found that perceived compatibility was
positively associated with intentions to purchase travel online.
Thus, it is hypothesised that:
H5: Individuals' perceived compatibility with online travel
shopping will be positively related to attitude towards online
travel shopping.
H6: Individuals' perceived compatibility with online travel
shopping will be positively related to intentions to purchase
travel online.

2.6. Perceived behavioural control
Perceived behavioural control was added to the TRA to overcome the original model's limitations in dealing with behaviours
over which people have incomplete volitional control (Ajzen, 1991),
creating the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Indeed the TRA can
predict behaviours from intentions with a high degree of accuracy,
provided that the behaviours are under volitional control (Ajzen &
Fishbein, 1980), otherwise behaviours may not be performed.
When people believe that they have the resources and opportunities and that the obstacles they may encounter can be overcomed,
then they shall have the conﬁdence to perform the behaviour, and
therefore exhibit a high degree of perceived behavioural control
(Ajzen, 2002).
Some researchers have argued that perceived behavioural control is not well understood (e.g. Pavlou & Fygenson, 2006;
Traﬁmow, Sheeran, Conner, & Finlay, 2002), with studies employing self-efﬁcacy instead of perceived behavioural control when
conducting research grounded on the TPB (e.g. Krueger, Reilly, &
Carsrud, 2000; Vijayasarathy, 2004). Although self-efﬁcacy and
perceived behavioural control are related concepts, they cannot be
used interchangeably and should be distinguished (Terry, 1993).
Self-efﬁcacy is related with cognitive perceptions of control based
on internal factors, while perceived behavioural control reﬂects
both internal and external factors (Armitage & Conner, 2001).

S. Amaro, P. Duarte / Tourism Management 46 (2015) 64e79

More than 10 years after perceived behavioural control was
added to the TRA Ajzen (2002), aware of the problems with the
nature and measurement of this construct, explicitly recommended
the decomposition of perceived behavioural control in two components: self-efﬁcacy and controllability. While self-efﬁcacy refers
to ease or difﬁculty of performing a behaviour or conﬁdence in
one's ability to perform it, controllability refers to control over the
behaviour, or the beliefs about the extent to which performing the
behaviour is up to the actor (Ajzen, 2002).
The current study follows these recommendations and decomposes perceived behavioural control in two components: selfefﬁcacy and controllability. This structure maintains the parsimonious unitary view of perceived behavioural control and provides a
more detailed prediction of external control beliefs by allowing a
distinct prediction of self-efﬁcacy and controllability, which will
lead to a better prediction of perceived behavioural control,
intention and behaviour (Pavlou & Fygenson, 2006).
For the purpose of this study, the following deﬁnitions will be
considered:
 Online travel shopping self-efﬁcacy: Following Pavlou and
Fygenson (2006) and Vijayasarathy (2004), online travel shopping self-efﬁcacy is deﬁned as consumers' self-assessment of
their own capabilities to purchase travel online.
 Controllability: Grounded on Ajzen's (2002) and Pavlou and
Fygenson's (2006) deﬁnitions, controllability is deﬁned as individual judgements about the availability of resources and
opportunities to purchase travel online.
The relationship between perceived behavioural control and
intentions to purchase travel online has clearly been underlooked
 et al.'s (2010) study was the only one that used the
at. Bigne
perceived behavioural control construct and found that it did not
directly inﬂuence users' intention to purchase airline tickets online.
In a different study, that considered facilitating conditions, a
concept similar to perceived behavioural control, San Martín and
Herrero (2012) found that they failed to predict intentions to
book a room online.
Grounded on the TPB, that conceptualises that perceived
behavioural control is held to contribute to intentions (Ajzen, 1991),
this study proposes the following hypothesis:
H7: Individuals' perceived behavioural control over purchasing
travel online positively inﬂuences intentions to purchase travel
online.
Hernandez, Jimenez, and Martín (2009) demonstrated that individuals who felt they had the capability of purchasing online
would perceive online shopping as easier to use. Hence, it is
hypothesised that:
H8: Individuals' perceived behavioural control over purchasing
travel online negatively inﬂuences perceived complexity.

Since the current study is interested in understanding users' perceptions of the advantages of online travel shopping over traditional channels, relative advantage is considered to be more
adequate than perceived usefulness, since it is a broader concept.
For the purposes of the current study, relative advantage is
deﬁned as the degree to which online travel shopping provides
beneﬁts to consumers or is better than its alternatives, such as
purchasing at high street travel agencies or directly contacting
travel suppliers by telephone or fax.
From the literature, several major issues emerge as advantages
of online travel shopping and have typically included convenience
(Heung, 2003; Jensen, 2009; Kim & Kim, 2004; Kim, Ma, & Kim,
2006; Kolsaker, Lee-Kelley, & Choy, 2004; Mayr & Zins, 2009),
ﬁnancial advantages, such as lower prices (Kim & Kim, 2004; Kim,
Kim, & Han, 2007; Kim et al., 2006), time saving (Christou &
Kassianidis, 2003; Heung, 2003; Wong & Law, 2005), enjoyment
(Cho & Agrusa, 2006; Powley, Cobanoglu, & Cummings, 2004) and
product variety (Jensen, 2009).
The current study considers that these are the pertinent dimensions of relative advantage, because they represent ways in
which online travel shopping can offer advantages over traditional
channels. Hence, relative advantages of online shopping are conceptualised as a multidimensional construct that captures these
beneﬁts of online shopping. This overall abstraction is believed to
be theoretically meaningful and parsimonious to use as a representation of the dimensions (Law, Chi-Sum, & Mobley, 1998).
The perceived relative advantages of online travel shopping
have been found to affect intentions to purchase online (Christou &
Kassianidis, 2003; Kim & Kim, 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Moital,
Vaughan, Edwards, & Peres, 2009; Wong & Law, 2005) and also
inﬂuences the adoption of online travel shopping (Heung, 2003;
Jensen, 2009; Kamarulzaman, 2007; Morrison et al., 2001).
Based on these arguments, the following hypothesis is posited:
H9: Perceived relative advantages of online travel shopping will
be positively related to intentions to purchase travel online.
Additionally, grounded on the TAM that suggests the perceived
usefulness (that is considered to be integrated in the relative advantages construct) affects attitude, it is hypothesised that:
H10: Perceived relative advantage of online travel shopping will
be positively related to attitudes towards online travel shopping.
To the best of our knowledge, a relationship that has never been
explored in online shopping is the one between perceived relative
advantages and trust. In the context of Internet banking, Suh and Han
(2002) found that customers' perceived usefulness had a positive
impact on trust in Internet banking. Based on this ﬁnding, it is argued
that individuals who perceive the relative advantages of online travel
shopping are more likely to trust online shopping and therefore:
H11: Perceived relative advantage of online travel shopping will
increase trust in online travel shopping.

2.7. Perceived relative advantage
2.8. Perceived risk
One of the IDT core constructs is relative advantages, a concept
similar to TAM's perceived usefulness. In fact, many researchers
consider that they are equivalent (Lee & Kozar, 2008;
Riemenschneider, Hardgrave, & Davis, 2002; Wu & Wang, 2005).
However, there exists an important distinction between the two
concepts since relative advantages explicitly contain a comparison
between the innovation and its precursor, while perceived usefulness does not (Karahanna, Ahuja, Srite, & Galvin, 2002; Shin, 2010).

The present study is concerned in examining the perceived risk
with the Internet as the purchase method for travel and not with
the travel service itself. Accordingly, perceived risk is deﬁned as the
potential loss perceived by a consumer in considering the purchase
of travel online when compared to the purchase of travel ofﬂine.
Surprisingly, very little research has looked at perceived risk
associated with online travel shopping (Lin et al., 2009). Studies

68

S. Amaro, P. Duarte / Tourism Management 46 (2015) 64e79

have evidenced that perceived risk is negatively related to the
purchase of airline tickets online (Kim, Kim, & Leong, 2005; Kim
et al., 2009; Kolsaker et al., 2004). Considering not just airline
tickets but all types of travel services, Jensen (2012) found that
perceived risk was negatively related to consumers' intention to
purchase travel online.
Since research has attested that perceived risk has a negative
effect on intentions to purchase travel online (Jensen, 2012; Kolsaker

et al., 2004) and on attitude towards online travel shopping (Bigne
et al., 2010) the following research hypotheses are proposed:
H12: The perceived risk of online travel shopping has a negative
inﬂuence on attitude towards online travel shopping.
H13: The perceived risk of online travel shopping has a negative
inﬂuence on intentions to purchase travel online.

2.9. Trust
Trust in online travel shopping is deﬁned as “an attitude of
conﬁdent expectation in an online situation of risk that one's vulnerabilities will not be exploited” (Corritore, Kracher, &
Wiedenbeck, 2003, p. 740). Research has shown that people are
more prone to purchase online if they perceive a higher trust in
online shopping (e.g. Corbitt et al., 2003). Indeed, trust plays a
central role on online purchases, because consumers will hesistate
to purchase if they feel uncertainty and risk (McKnight, Choudhury,
& Kacmar, 2002). In a more extreme view, Wang and Emurian
(2005) posit that the future of online shopping depends on trust.
Despite the importance of trust, Kim et al. (2011) state that there
is a lack of research regarding perceived trust in online shopping for
tourism products and services. Therefore, it is relevant to add trust
since the few studies that have considered trust in online travel
shopping have also produced mixed results. For example, while
Wen (2010) claimed that consumers' trust in online shopping had a
positive effect on intentions to purchase travel online,
Kamarulzaman (2007) did not ﬁnd a direct effect on the adoption of
online travel shopping. To clarify these mixed results, the following
hypothesis was set forth:
H14: Trust in online travel shopping has a positive inﬂuence on
intentions to purchase travel online.
Other research has found that trust inﬂuences attitude towards
 et al., 2010) and negatively inﬂuences
online shopping (Bigne
perceived risk (Kamarulzaman, 2007). Thus, it is hypothesised that:
H15: Trust in online travel shopping has a positive inﬂuence on
attitude towards online shopping.
H16: Trust in online travel shopping has a negative inﬂuence on
perceived risk of online travel shopping.
Fig. 1 graphically summarises the research hypotheses.
3. Methodology
3.1. Sampling and data collection
Theoretically, the population comprises all Internet users aged
18 or more as they have already purchased travel online or exhibit a
greater propensity to shop online. However, since there does not
exist a list of Internet users it is impossible to select our sampling
elements from the population directly. Consequently, a nonprobabilistic sampling procedure e convenience sampling e was
used to collect data.

To collect the data the questionnaire was distributed online,
using the Survey Gizmo questionnaire tool (www.surveygizmo.
com). Since the study focuses on online travel shopping, it was
not necessary to address the concerns of individuals that do not
have access to the Internet.
In late July of 2012, e-mail invitations were sent to colleagues,
students, personal contacts, professional list-serve lists, and other
e-mail contacts collected. The e-mail invitations provided respondents with information on the purpose of the study, the
approximate time to ﬁll out the questionnaire and information on
the prize draw for those who completed the survey. Moreover, links
to the survey were placed on Facebook and LinkedIn.
These contacts and list-serve lists were composed majority of
Portuguese Internet users, but also Internet users from all over the
world. Therefore, the questionnaire was available in Portuguese
and in English. Each language had its own URL link, although it was
possible to switch languages on the ﬁrst page of the questionnaire.
The questionnaire was available online between July 17th and
September 12th of 2012. During this period, a total of 1759 responses was obtained. Since the total number of responses was
large, the complete case approach was used (Hair, Black, Babin, &
Anderson, 2010) and responses with missing values were eliminated. Thus, a total of 1732 responses was considered valid for
further analyses. It should be stressed that the most common rule
to determine sample size for PLS estimation consists in determining the sample according to the most complex multiple
regression in the model, which consists in either the number of
indicators on the most complex formative construct or the largest
number of antecedents leading to a construct in the inner model
(Barclay, Higgins, & Thompson, 1995). Once determined which is
greater, the sample size required is 10 cases per predictor. In the
proposed model, the most complex regression involves the number
of structural paths directed at the intentions to purchase travel
online construct, which are seven. Thus, according to this rule, the
minimum sample size necessary would be 70. With 1732 responses, the PLS analysis appears to have sufﬁcient power.
3.2. Questionnaire and measurements
The questionnaire for the current study was divided into 2 main
sections. The ﬁrst section contained questions directed to the scale
items (indicators), selected to measure each construct based on
existing measures or adapted from similar scales (see Appendix 1 for
the items used and sources). All items were measured using a 5-point
Likert scale, with 5 being “Strongly Agree” and 1 “Strongly Disagree”,
except for item INT1, in which 5 was “Very High” and 1 “Very Low”.
It should be noted that all ﬁrst-order constructs have a reﬂective
measurement, where the indicators are considered to be functions
of the latent construct (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011; Hair et al.,
2010). The second-order constructs (perceived relative advantages and perceived behavioural control), however, have a formative measurement, since the ﬁrst-order variables are assumed to
cause the second-order variables, i.e., changes in the ﬁrst-order
variables would cause changes in the underlying variable (Jarvis,
MacKenzie, & Podsakoff, 2003).3
The last section of the questionnaire contained questions
regarding respondents' demographic characteristics, namely age,
gender and education level. In this section, respondents were also
asked to leave their e-mail contact in case they wanted to enter the

The second-order constructs were operationalised using the repeated indicator
approach as it produces more precise parameter estimates and a more reliable
higher-order construct score for reﬂective-formative hierarchical constructs
(Becker, Klein, & Wetzels, 2012).

prize draw of an Amazon voucher and a free night at a 5 star hotel,
offered in order to increase response rates. To prevent duplicate
responses, the option to control and remove duplicate responses by
IP address available in the Surveygizmo platform was used. The
online questionnaire listed only a few questions per screen, as there
is some evidence that suggests that this procedure minimises
abandonment (Schonlau, Fricker, & Elliott, 2002).
3.3. Data analysis
Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM),
using the SmartPLS 2.0 programme (Ringle, Wende, & Will, 2005),
was used to validate the measures developed and test the hypotheses. This approach readily incorporates both reﬂective and
formative measures and has less restrictive assumptions about the
data (Hair, Ringle, Hult, & Sarstedt, 2013; Hair, Sarstedt, Pieper, &
Ringle, 2012; Hair et al., 2011). For instance, PLS does not require
a normal distribution since it uses bootstrapping to empirically
estimate standard error for its parameter estimates (Gefen, Rigdon,
& Straub, 2011; Henseler, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2012). Therefore,
normality in the distribution was not checked for. Moreover, constructs with fewer items can be used. Since ﬁve constructs in the
model (Intentions to purchase travel online, Perceived Compatibility, Enjoyment, Self-efﬁcacy and Controllability) only have two
items, this characteristic seemed relevant.
4. Results
4.1. Socio-demographic characteristics
A demographic proﬁle of survey participants is summarised in
Table 1. The age group with the most signiﬁcant number of

responses was the age group 18e29, with 34.6% of the total of responses, while only approximately 13% are aged over 50.
In terms of gender, there is a slight skew towards a higher
proportion of female participants (61.5%). The sample seems to be
composed by highly educated individuals, with approximately 88%
of the respondents holding at least a college degree, against only
11.6% who have only completed the 12th grade or less. Regarding
the country of residence, there was a prominence of responses from
European residents.

4.2. Model assessment
The evaluation of a research model using PLS analysis consists of
two distinct steps. The ﬁrst step includes the assessment of the
measurement (outer) model and deals with evaluating the characteristics of the constructs and measurement items that represent
them. The second step involves the assessment of the structural
(inner) model and the evaluation of the relationships between the
constructs as speciﬁed by the research model. It should be noted
that PLS path modelling does not provide any global goodness-ofﬁt criterion, as CB-SEM does, which implies a lack of measures for
overall model ﬁt (Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle, & Mena, 2012; Henseler
et al., 2012).
4.2.1. Measurement model
The ﬁrst part in evaluating a model is to present the outer model
results to examine the reliability and validity of the measures used
to represent each construct (Chin, 2010). However, procedures used
to assess the validity and reliability of reﬂective constructs are
different than the ones used to assess formative constructs
(Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer, 2001). Since the model has both
reﬂective and formative measurements, the measurement model
assessment will be divided to distinguish these two types of
constructs.
4.2.1.1. Reﬂective measurement. Assessment of reﬂective constructs
involves determining indicator reliability, internal consistency
reliability, convergent validity and discriminant validity, as
described by Hair et al. (2011) and Henseler, Ringle, and Sinkovics
(2009).
As shown in Table 2, all measures are robust in terms of their
reliability, since all Cronbach's alpha are higher than 0.7, except for
Controllability with 0.628, but still above the acceptable threshold
of 0.6 (Hair et al., 2010). Furthermore, the composite reliabilities,
that many researchers consider more suitable for PLS-SEM than
Cronbach's alpha (e.g. Hair et al., 2011; Henseler et al., 2009), range
from 0.84 to 0.97, which exceed the recommended threshold value
of 0.70 (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988). Finally, all indicator loadings are above
the 0.6 cut-off (Chin, 1998; Henseler et al., 2009).
To evaluate convergent validity, as suggested by Fornell and
Larcker (1981), each construct's AVE was calculated (see Table 2).
The results support convergent validity, since they all exceed 0.50,
ranging from 0.57 to 0.89.
Discriminant validity was assessed following Fornell and
Larcker (1981) guidelines, to examine if a construct is more
strongly related to its own measures than with any other construct
by examining the overlap in variance by comparing the AVE of each
construct with the squared correlations among constructs (Chin,
2010). Table 3 shows the correlations between constructs, where
the diagonal elements are the square roots of the AVEs. As
observed, the square root of each construct's AVE is larger than its
correlations with any other construct. Therefore, each construct
shares more variance with its own block of indicators than with
another latent variable representing a different block of indicators
(Henseler et al., 2009), supporting the adequate discriminant validity of the scales.
Discriminant validity was further assessed by extracting the
factor and cross loadings of all indicators to their respective constructs. Not only should each indicator be strongly related to the
construct it attempts to reﬂect, but also should not have a stronger
connection with another construct (Chin, 2010). The results, presented in Appendix 2, indicate that all indicators loaded on their
respective construct more highly than on any other, conﬁrming that
the constructs are distinct.

In conclusion, these results provide support for the overall
quality of the reﬂective constructs' measures.

4.2.1.2. Formative constructs. The formative constructs proposed in
the model e perceived behavioural control and perceived relative
advantages - are second-order constructs. Tests of measurement
quality for a second-order factor model should, by analogy, follow
the same process that is used to examine the ﬁrst-order factors
(Chin, 1998). Therefore, the assessments of measurement quality of
second-order constructs are conducted in two stages, at the ﬁrstorder construct level (carried out in the previous section, since all
ﬁrst-order constructs are reﬂective) and at the second-order
construct level, in which the ﬁrst-order constructs act as indicators
of the second-order construct (Hair et al., 2010).
The weights of the ﬁrst-order constructs on the second-order
constructs and their signiﬁcance were examined (see Table 4), to
assess if each ﬁrst-order construct contributes to form the second-order construct (Chin, 1998; Hair et al., 2011). For a formative higher-order construct, the weights of the lower-order
constructs are especially important as they represent actionable
drivers of the higher-order construct (Becker, Klein, & Wetzels,
2012).
All ﬁrst-order constructs weights are signiﬁcant, which means
that there is empirical support for the ﬁrst-order constructs relevance for the construction of the formative second-order constructs
as theoretically conceived, demonstrating a sufﬁcient level of validity (Hair et al., 2011; Urbach & Ahlemann, 2010). Moreover, the
weights are higher than 0.10 and their sign is consistent with the
underlying theory (Andreev, Heart, Maoz, & Pliskin, 2009).
Regarding perceived relative advantages, it should be noted that
ﬁnancial advantages, time saving and convenience are the most
relevant advantages.
Another important criterion for assessing the validity of the
ﬁrst-order constructs is to examine multicollinearity. Unlike constructs with a reﬂective measurement, where multicollinearity
between construct items is desirable, excessive multicollinearity
between the formative ﬁrst-order constructs can destabilise the
model (Diamantopoulos & Winklhofer, 2001) and may cause the
weights to be non-signiﬁcant and, therefore, redundant (Hair et al.,
2011). If the ﬁrst-order constructs are highly correlated, it may
suggest that they are tapping into the same aspect of the construct
(Petter, Straub, & Rai, 2007) and therefore, a formative nature for
the second-order construct would be inappropriate. Therefore, to
ensure that multicollinearity was not present, the variance inﬂation
factor (VIF) was determined, with values varying from 1.504 to a
maximum of 3.083, which is far below the common cut-off
threshold of 5 (Hair et al., 2011).
At the second-order construct level it is important to assess the
nomological validity, i.e., if the formative construct carries the
intended meaning. This may be manifested in the magnitude and
signiﬁcance of the relationships between the second-order
formative construct and other constructs in the research model,
which are expected to be strong and signiﬁcant based on previous
research (Henseler et al., 2009).
Table 5 shows the relationships between the second-order
constructs and other constructs in the model, according to the
hypotheses proposed in the model.
The results indicate signiﬁcant relationships between perceived
behavioural control and perceived relative advantages with other
constructs in the model, consistent with underlying theory, indicating nomological validity. Although perceived relative advantage
does not exhibit a signiﬁcant effect on intentions to purchase travel
online, as hypothesised, this is due to the mediating effect of attitude, as will further be discussed.

t-values were obtained with the bootstrapping procedure (5000 samples) and are signiﬁcant at the 0.001 level.

4.2.2. Inner model assessment
Since the outer model evaluation provided evidence of reliability and validity, the inner model estimates were examined to
assess the hypothesised relationships among the constructs in the
conceptual model (Hair et al., 2013). The inner model proposed in
this study was evaluated with several measures, following Henseler
et al.'s (2009, 2012) and Hair et al.'s (2013) recommendations.
The standardised path coefﬁcients and signiﬁcance levels provide evidence of the inner model's quality (Hair, Sarstedt, Ringle
et al., 2012) and allow researchers to test their proposed

hypotheses. The path coefﬁcients and signiﬁcance levels are illustrated in Fig. 2.
The total effects (indirect effect þ direct effect) of the independent constructs on the dependent ones were also examined,
since they provide practitioners with actionable results regarding
cause-effect relationships. Table 6 shows the direct, indirect and
total effects of the predictors of the main dependent variable of the
model, intentions to purchase travel online.
The ﬁrst hypothesis predicted that attitude towards online
travel shopping would positively inﬂuence intentions to purchase

travel online. Consistent with intention based models and with

other studies conducted in the online travel context (e.g. Bigne
et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007; Morosan & Jeong, 2008), attitude
was found to be signiﬁcantly associated with intentions to purchase
travel online (b ¼ 0.55, p < 0.001).
The second and third hypotheses proposed that communicability inﬂuences intentions to purchase travel online and perceived
risk. The former hypothesis was based on Morrison et al.'s (2001)
ﬁndings that people were more likely to book online if they knew
that many other people were doing likewise. However, this hypothesis was not supported (b ¼ 0.01, p ¼ 0.33). This result is not
totally unexpected, since the inﬂuence of others to perform behaviours in volunteering settings e such as the purchase of travel
online e has been found to be weak or non-existent (e.g. Davis
et al., 1989; Hsu & Chiu, 2004; San Martín & Herrero, 2012; Shih
& Fang, 2004). The current results support Li and Buhalis's (2006)
ﬁndings that communicability is not an important factor in
explaining the purchase of travel online. The latter hypothesis
pertaining that communicability would reduce people's perceived
risk regarding the purchase of travel online was also not supported
(b ¼ 0.03, p ¼ 0.09). Both hypotheses using communicability were
rejected leading us to interesting conclusions. It suggests that the
inﬂuence of friends tends to diminish as the purchase of travel
online gets more widespread and that it is most likely that this
inﬂuence is important for new phenomenon.
The fourth hypothesis that stated “Individuals' perceived
complexity of online travel shopping will be negatively related to
attitude towards online travel shopping”, was supported
(b ¼ 0.05, p < 0.05). This ﬁnding is right in line with the IDT that
posits that innovations that are simpler to understand will be
adopted more quickly (Rogers, 1995). Purchasing travel online can
be a complex process, since there are many travel suppliers online
and different procedures to conclude the purchase. Internet users
that feel that it is complex will have a less favourable attitude towards the purchase of travel online. However, this effect is

relatively weak. Complexity appears to be relevant when an individual ﬁrst starts a new behaviour, but after a period of time its
inﬂuence becomes less signiﬁcant (Vijayasarathy, 2004).
Internet users' perception about the compatibility of online
travel shopping appears to be a strong predictor of online travel
shopping. Indeed, the ﬁfth and sixth hypothesis predicting a relationship with attitude and intentions to purchase travel online,
respectively, were supported (b ¼ 0.47, p < 0.001 and b ¼ 0.20,
p < 0.001). This result suggests that people who feel that online
travel shopping is compatible with their lifestyle will have a more
favourable attitude towards online travel shopping and can be expected to purchase travel online more readily.
The seventh and eighth hypotheses were concerned with the
role of perceived behavioural control, a construct borrowed from
the TPB. The seventh hypothesis was supported by the data
(b ¼ 0.10, p < 0.001), indicating that perceived behavioural control
positively inﬂuences intentions to purchase travel online, echoing
the postulation of the TPB. This result helps to better clarify the
contradictory ﬁnding of a previous study regarding the purchase of
 et al., 2010) that had found that perceived
travel online (Bigne
behavioural control did not affect intentions to purchase travel
online.
Data analysis also indicates that perceived behavioural control
has a signiﬁcant negative effect on perceived complexity
(b ¼ 0.64, p < 0.001), which indicates that individuals who feel
they have the capability and resources to purchase online will
perceive online shopping as easier to use, consistent with the
ﬁndings of other studies (e.g. Hernandez et al., 2009).
The tenth hypotheses that predicted that perceived relative
advantages of online travel shopping would positively affect intentions to purchase travel online was accepted (b ¼ 0.00, p ¼ 0.38).
However, contrary to what was expected, hypothesis nine, that
established a positive relationship between perceived relative advantages and intentions to purchase travel online was not supported (b ¼ 0.00, p ¼ 0.38). Yet, Table 6 shows that perceived

relative advantages have a signiﬁcant total effect on intentions to
purchase travel online (b ¼ 0.19, p < 0.001). Further examinations
following Holmbeck (1997) recommendations and Sobel's (1982) Zstatistic proved that attitude totally mediated the relationship between perceived relative advantages and intentions to purchase
travel online. Therefore, the unsupported hypothesis must be
analysed with caution. Not only is the total effect of perceived
relative advantages on intentions to purchase travel online significant, but also it is one of its most important predictors.
Hypothesis 11, that expected a positive relationship between
perceived relative advantages and trust was conﬁrmed (b ¼ 0.54,
p < 0.001). This was an important ﬁnding, since this relationship
has never been explored in the context of online travel shopping.
This means that Internet users trust in online shopping can be
increased by emphasising the perceived relative advantages of
online travel shopping.
Hypotheses 12 and 13 concerned the inﬂuence of perceived risk
of online travel shopping on attitude and intentions to purchase
travel online. The latter hypothesis was supported (b ¼ 0.12,
p < 0.001), while the former was not (b ¼ 0.03, p ¼ 0.18). Although
perceived risk does not affect attitude towards online shopping, it
may inhibit individuals from purchasing travel online, since it
negatively inﬂuences intentions.
Few studies have addressed trust in the context of online travel
shopping and the few that have done so reached different conclusions. Hypotheses 14 and 15, proposing that trust would be

positively associated with attitude and negatively associated with
perceived risk were conﬁrmed (b ¼ 0.11, p < 0.001 and b ¼ 0.72,
 et al. (2010) and of
p < 0.001), supporting the ﬁndings of Bigne
Kamarulzaman (2007) that trust inﬂuences perceived risk and
attitude. However, contrary to these authors that did not ﬁnd a
direct impact of trust on intentions, the results of this study support
this relationship, accepting hypothesis 16 (b ¼ 0.06, p < 0.05). It
should however be noted that it has a small impact.
To evaluate the predictive power of the research model, a major
emphasis in PLS analysis is to examine the explained variance (R2)
of the endogenous constructs4 (Chin, 2010) that indicate the
amount of variance in the construct which is explained by the
model.
As shown in Fig. 2, R2 values range from 0.289 to 0.67, which
indicates that the model has high predictive value and is capable of
explaining endogenous constructs.
Another approach to assess predictive relevance is to apply the
predictive sample reuse technique developed by Geisser (1975) and
Stone (1974) , known as the StoneeGeisser's Q2. The Q2 values of the
endogenous constructs were calculated in SmartPLS, with the
blindfolding procedure, and were all superior to zero (ranging from
0.17 to 0.58), indicative of the endogenous constructs' predictive
relevance.
5. Conclusions and implications
From a theoretical perspective, this study has made several
advances. First, because it examines online travel shopping based
on a holistic approach, integrating several theoretical models and
validates the integration of these theories in the context of online
travel shopping. It conﬁrms attitude and perceived behavioural
control as predictors of intentions as postulated in the TRA
(Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), and TPB (Ajzen, 1991), respectively. The

It should be noted that when the repeated indicators approach is used, the
variance of the second-order construct is perfectly explained by its lower components, therefore R2 ¼ 1.0 (Ringle, Sarstedt, & Straub, 2012). Therefore the R2 of the
second-order constructs is not reported.

study shows that Rogers' (1995) IDT can be used to explain intentions to purchase travel online, since the innovations characteristics of relative advantages, compatibility and complexity are
valid predictors of intentions to purchase travel online. The results
also indicate that the IDT is superior to TAM, since adding
compatibility increases the explained variance. More, the study
demonstrates that perceived relative advantages and complexity
(similar to perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use,
respectively, from the TAM) are important predictors of attitude
towards online shopping. By integrating all these theories and
adding other relevant constructs, a holistic view was obtained,
providing more information than studies with fragmented results.
Considering that research with multidimensional constructs
using PLS path modelling is still limited (Wetzels, OdekerkenSchroder, & van Oppen, 2009), this study ﬁlls this gap by using
multidimensional constructs to operationalise three constructs.
Using multidimensional constructs enhance the understanding of
the overall construct (Law et al., 1998), by providing detail on
different facets of the construct (Petter et al., 2007). In particular:
- The empirical results have shown that perceived behavioural
control can be conceptualised as a second-order construct,
formed by two distinct dimensions: self-efﬁcacy and controllability. Although Ajzen (2002) recommends decomposing
perceived behavioural control in this manner, no study focussing on online travel purchasing intentions had conceptualised
perceived behavioural control in this way.
- This study has shown that perceived relative advantages can be
operationalised as a multidimensional construct, composed by
convenience, time saving, ﬁnancial advantages, enjoyment and
product variety. Each dimension represents a facet of the advantages of purchasing travel online, identiﬁed in the literature
review.
Although not a part of the main aim of this research, other
ﬁndings have been made concerning the role of several constructs
that were unexplored or had contradictory results. For instance,
 et al., 2010) considered perceived behavonly one study (Bigne
ioural control and, contrary to what the TPB posits, it found that it
did not affect intentions to purchase travel online. However, this
study's results are consistent with the TPB, since they show that
perceived behavioural control affects intentions to purchase travel
online.
At a time when Internet use and online travel shopping are more
prevalent, factors such as perceived behavioural control or
perceived complexity with online travel shopping play a small role.
What really matters for Internet users to purchase travel online is
having a favourable attitude towards online travel shopping and
ﬁnding it compatible with their lifestyle. Furthermore, individuals
that perceive the advantages of purchasing travel online, namely
time saving, convenience and ﬁnancial aspects, will be more likely
to purchase travel online. It is also interesting to note that even
though trust and security in computer systems are increasing
(Bogdanovych, Berger, Simoff, & Sierra, 2006) and online shopping
is nowadays a common practice, perceived risk continues to
negatively affect intentions to purchase travel online.
It is evident that attitude towards online travel shopping is the
most relevant determinant of intentions to purchase travel online.
Therefore, online travel marketers need to pay close attention to
the factors that contribute to a favourable attitude. This study has
evidenced some of those factors, namely trust, complexity and
perceived relative advantages.
Fam, Foscht, and Collins (2004) found that in order to increase
trust in online shopping, providers should offer a warranty of
refund to consumers, reassure that the information provided will

remain conﬁdential and private, provide formal guarantees of service and/or products, inform if the travel service is available at the
time of purchase and welcome feedback and comments. Providing
explanations of all the costs involved, offering reliable security
measures, no disclosure of credit card details, using the latest
encryption technology, explaining how the information collected
will be used, providing a functional navigation and having a welldesigned website are other actions that can increase trust in online travel shopping (Austin, Ibeh, & Yee, 2006; Chen, 2006; Kim
et al., 2011; Wen, 2010).
Since perceived relative advantages is a signiﬁcant predictor of
attitude towards online travel shopping, online travel providers
need to emphasise the advantages of purchasing travel online,
bearing in mind the advantages that potential buyers most value.
The results of the current study have revealed that ﬁnancial advantages are viewed as a major advantage. Therefore, online travel
providers should guarantee the lowest price and offer other
ﬁnancial advantages such as discounts, coupons and other ﬁnancial
incentives. For example, Intercontinental Hotels Group guarantee
that they have the lowest price, by offering the ﬁrst night for customers that ﬁnd a lower price elsewhere. This is even more
important considering that travellers have pointed out the lack of
conﬁdence that they are getting a good deal as one of the main
reasons why they experience frustration online (PhocusWright,
2012).
The results support that convenience and time saving are also
important advantages for travellers to purchase travel online. Online travel providers should provide procedures that are convenient
to travellers such as easy payment features or personalised information based on past behaviours. They can strive to satisfy these
needs by, for example, making relevant bits of scattered information convenient and easy to retrieve (PhocusWright, 2012) and
make suggestions based on customers' past bookings.
The second most important predictor of intentions to purchase
travel online in the model is the Internet user's compatibility. As
Vijayasarathy (2004) points out, individuals that ﬁnd online travel
shopping compatible with their lifestyles may be “time starved and
constantly exploring ways to reduce the time to complete various
tasks to manage their busy schedules” (p.757). This is further
reinforced by the results obtained in perceived relative advantages,
as time saving and convenience were found to be signiﬁcant advantages of purchasing travel online. With hundreds of options
resulting from an online search, travellers are often overloaded and
feel frustrated (PhocusWright, 2012). Therefore, online travel providers should take advantage of technological advances, by analysing travellers' past behaviour to deliver personalised results and
offer relevant promotions. Furthermore, considering that one third
of mobile users are planning on the go (Koumelis, 2012), online
travel providers should provide apps for mobile devices and tablets
to purchase travel, with other features that facilitate convenience,
such as boarding pass or check in.
The results also support the important role that perceived risk
plays in purchasing travel online. Therefore, online travel providers
must provide effective ways to reduce users' perceived risk to
enhance Internet users' willingness to purchase travel online. A
strong ﬁrm reputation is important to reduce the risk associated
with online shopping (Cases, 2002; Eastlick, Lotz, & Warrington,
2006; Kim et al., 2009). Consequently, online travel providers
should strive to build a good reputation, by, for example, cooperating with partners who already have a good reputation (GrabnerKraeuter, 2002), but also by providing fulﬁlling and satisfying
transactions. Other risk reduction strategies are to provide travellers with information on their consumer rights and personal data,
having a security approval symbol (e.g. VeriSign), provide contact
information, offer money back guarantees, and have high security

S. Amaro, P. Duarte / Tourism Management 46 (2015) 64e79

standards that should be communicated to consumers, as well as
clear privacy information protecting consumers' personal infor et al., 2010; Cases, 2002; Kim et al., 2009; Lin et al.,
mation (Bigne
2009; Powley et al., 2004; Vijayasarathy, 2004).
Trust presents a statistical signiﬁcant impact on intentions to
purchase travel online. However it is almost insigniﬁcant, contradicting a recent study that found that trust was the main predictor
of intentions to purchase ﬂights from low-cost carrier websites
(Escobar-Rodríguez & Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014). This ﬁnding points to
the need for further investigation on the role of trust, as it is
reasonable to assume that it may vary depending on the type of
travel product being bought.
6. Limitations and future research
Even though the proposed model has been developed on a rich
theoretical background, as in any research project, this study has
limitations. First, the data used in this study were based on a
convenience sample and, therefore, generalisations of the results
must be made with caution. Although being a strong sample in
terms of diversity and size, the examination of the respondents'
characteristics shows a high proportion of respondents with higher
education levels, which should not be ignored when assessing the
conclusions. The replication of this study with a more balanced
proportion of Internet users regarding the country of residence
would be desirable.
Another limitation of this study is related to the deﬁnition of
online travel purchases. In this study, the deﬁnition considered is
broad, since it includes the purchase of airline tickets, cruises,
holiday packages and hotel reservations. Thus, further studies
should study online purchasing motivations considering distinct
travel product categories, rather than considering travel as one
category. Indeed, a few studies (Bogdanovych et al., 2006;
Kamarulzaman, 2007) has found that travellers usually purchase
less complex travel online and prefer booking complex travel from
a travel agent. Therefore, the results obtained in this study may
differ if applied only to low complexity travel or to high complexity
travel. On the other hand, the deﬁnition does not consider the
different devises people may use to purchase travel online. Given
the increasing penetration of smartphones, for example, future
research could investigate if the results hold independently of the
devise used.
A third limitation of this study was that it did not consider crosscultural issues. For example, Heung's (2003) study concluded that
online travel purchasers were more likely to be from Western
countries. In a similar vein, Law, Bai, and Leung (2008) found that
Americans had a higher propensity to purchase travel online than
the Chinese. Future research should study which factors in the

75

proposed model are culture speciﬁc and which are cross-cultural.
Studying the differences across nations is important in deciding
which marketing elements may be standardised globally (Pizam,
1999).
The data was analysed using PLS equation modelling on the total
sample. However, researchers have pointed out that this assumes
that the data are homogeneous, which can be unrealistic (Ringle,
Sarstedt, & Schlittgen, 2010). Therefore, future research may use
multi-group analyses to identify if there is heterogeneity or
segment level differences. In SmartPLS this can be done with the
ﬁnite mixture PLS (FIMIX-PLS) tool. This approach identiﬁes
different segments and their estimates for the relationships between constructs in the structural model (Ringle, 2006). A better
understanding of the factors that inﬂuence intentions to purchase
travel online in different segments enhances the possibilities of
developing online marketing strategies that meet the needs of each
segment.
Given attitude's importance in explaining intentions to purchase
travel online, it is essential to examine the factors affecting attitude
formation, besides the ones considered in this study. For example,
prior experience with online travel purchases (e.g. Morosan &
Jeong, 2006), perceived playfulness (e.g. Morosan & Jeong, 2008),
enjoyment (e.g. Hassanein & Head, 2007) and personal innovativeness (e.g. Limayem et al., 2000) have been found to affect attitude towards online shopping.
In a similar vein, although the antecedents of intentions to
purchase online explained a substantial amount of its variance,
there may be other important factors which have not been included
in the model, representing an opportunity for further research. For
instance, satisfaction with previous online purchases (Kim et al.,
2006) and consumer shopping orientations (Jensen, 2012) may
explain intentions to purchase travel online.
Finally, there has been strong evidence that supports the link
between intended and actual behaviour. Yet, in the context of online shopping, this relationship has been largely overlooked. Future
research should assert this relationship between intentions to
purchase travel online and actual behaviour, since this relationship
has never been examined in the travel context.
In spite of several limitations, academic researchers, tourism
practitioners and marketers can take advantage of this study to
better understand the adoption of online travel shopping and
consequently improve online travel distribution strategies. The
recommendations for further investigations also provide researchers with challenging directions for future research.
