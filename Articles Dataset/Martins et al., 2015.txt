This research proposes an analysis of online consumer buying behavior in the travel and tourism
field in Portugal. The study utilizes a self-administrated survey on a sample of 380 individuals created in order to understand the influence of the Internet on consumer buying behavior. The survey
was administrated in Portugal, one of the European countries that are still struggling with Internet
penetration. Results show the importance of the Internet has on two stages of the buying process:
(i) alternative evaluation and (ii) buying act. Furthermore, this research highlights the critical role
of touristic products availability and search costs on the buying behavior of consumers. However,
past bad experiences and a certain level of insecurity persist as factors limiting the online purchase
process. Results confirm the general trends in consumer behavior and highlight the need of moving
further for Portugal in terms of technology adoption.

Introduction

2002). On the other side, travelers, who become
much more exigent (Buhalis & Law, 2008), are in
constant need of information and they are faced
with the task of finding the right information in the
tourism online domain (Xiang & Gretzel, 2010;
Xiang, Wöber, & Fesenmaier, 2008). Therefore, the
Internet brought a paradigm shift in travelers’ buying behavior, enlarging the choice of tourism product and making the “one click purchase” possible
(O’Connor, 2008). Nonetheless, two decades after
the commercial advent of the Internet (Sharma &

The advent of the Internet radically reshaped
the rules of engagement of tourism companies and
firms all over the world (Buhalis, 2003). In the digital age, communication has become much more
interactive (Hoffman & Novak, 1996). On the one
side, organizations and firms in travel and tourism
benefit from the advent of the Internet, by having new marketing and selling outlets in which to
present and sell their products (O’Connor & Frew,

MARTINS, SALAZAR, AND INVERSINI

Mehrotra, 2007) not all tourism firms in all countries are ready to embrace the Internet (r)evolution.
Likewise, not all consumers are ready to rely on
online information and online commerce.
This study analyzes the impact of the Internet on
travel purchase in Portugal for two main reasons:
1. Tourism represents a very important part of the
Portuguese GDP (around 11%) (United Nations
World Tourism Organization, 2006). The travel
industry is presenting positive trends within
the country (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica,
2012) and the government is seeking solutions
to increase its impact on the GDP (Turismo de
Portugal, 2009).
2. Technology adoption in the country is not very
high. Despite the fact that Portugal presented an
exponential growth from 2008 (46%) until 2012
(61%) in Internet-connected households, the
numbers are lower when compared with other
European countries [e.g., UK (81%) and Netherlands (94%)]. Countries like Romania, Bulgaria,
Greece, Cyprus, and Portugal have the highest
rates of non-Internet users (Eurostat, 2012). As
regards activities online, 59.1% of Portuguese
had visited tourism websites in 2012 (with booking.com as market leader), representing 31% of
total pages of tourism websites (Marktest, 2013).
Therefore, this study looks into online consumer
behavior in Portugal with the goal of (i) understand
the influence of the Internet in the purchase decision process of online touristic products and (ii) to
understand how the buying behavior of touristic
products is influenced by the Internet, thus shedding
light on Portuguese’s online habits. Particularly, the
study moves from the five stages of the purchase
decision process (Blackwell, Miniard, & Engel,
2006; Mowen & Minor, 2007; Reid & Bojanic,
2006) to better understand the factors influencing
the online decision-making process and the advantages and limitation of the Internet in supporting
the purchase decision.
Literature Review
Over the years, it was possible to observe a
substantial change of consumer behavior in tourism (Horner & Swarbrooke, 2007), intrinsically

associated with the transformations that have
occurred in the world economy towards digital communication (Buhalis & Law, 2008). In 1996, the
Internet was already widely recognized as an emerging tool in the context of marketing (Hoffman &
Novak, 1996), because it has unique features for
marketing activities that distinguish it from traditional trade instruments. According to Cantoni and
Tardini (2006), the importance of online communication has grown over recent years and transformed
the Internet into one of the major communication
tools, both at business and personal levels. Additionally, also thanks to the recent advent of the so-called
Web 2.0 (O’Reilly, 2007), the Internet is now seen as
an interactive media where communication is happening in a bidirectional way (Hoffman & Novak,
1996), enabling new business models (Inversini &
Masiero, 2014).
Within the tourism domain, the Internet (r)evolution brought a fundamental change in the overall value chain (Buhalis, 2003). On the one side,
tourism companies and organizations are understanding that a proper strategic and tactical use of
technologies can bring a competitive added value
(Inversini, Brülhart, & Cantoni, 2012). Consumers
become much more sophisticated and, thanks to the
Internet, they have the possibility of looking for
different options while choosing their travel plans
(Buhalis & Law, 2008). Additionally, consumers
are in constant need of information to inform their
decision-making process in all the stage of the tourism goods consumption.
According to Cetină, Munthiu, and Rădulescu
(2012), it is unquestionable that the digital revolution exerted one of the most powerful influences
on consumer behavior. Amor (2002) stated that
one of the biggest advantages of the Internet is its
global availability, with the consumer being influenced by the availability of the products. The rapid
growth of the Internet has changed the way people
search for information about hospitality and tourism services (Mattila, 2004). This topic attracted
a vast interest by academics (Jang, 2004). The
main issue related to information search is the possibility of locating the correct and relevant travel
and tourism information in the so-called “online
tourism domain” (Xiang et al., 2008). Assessing
online tourists’ behavior is part of the online tourism domain, where professionals can work with

INTERNET IMPACT ON TRAVEL PURCHASES
the demographic segmentation. Hsieh, O’Leary,
and Morrison (1992) argued that segmentation is a
management strategy based on assumptions about
the behavior of population subgroups, being able
to determine differences that are useful in selecting the target (Costa & Rita, 2000). Costa and Rita
(2000) emphasized that segmentation is a tool of
vital importance for tourism business management,
bringing market knowledge and prioritizing market
segments, positioning, and marketing strategies.
Analyzing consumers’ behavior means investigating the process, steps, buying influences, and
use of goods and services by consumers. Horner
and Swarbrooke (2007) define tourism consumer
behavior as “the study of the reasons for purchasing products for people, and how they make their
decisions” (p. 6). Understanding tourism consumer behavior is, among others, the most important challenge that marketers and managements
are facing (Reid & Bojanic, 2006). The consumer
goes through different stages until he/she makes
choices about products or services for consumption. Mowen and Minor (2007) report that decision
making of consumer purchase is a set of processes
involving recognizing problems, seeking solutions,
evaluating alternatives, choosing between options,
and evaluating results to choose from. The decision
of travel is a complex process that entails the solution of many subdecisions (Xiang et al., 2008). The
decision process of tourism consumer purchasing is
complex and involves internal and external factors
that influence it (Horner & Swarbrooke, 2007). The
internal factors that bound to the consumer decision
are: Personal reasons; Personality; Health; Past
experience; Commitment to the family; Commitment to work; Hobbies and interests; Knowledge;
Lifestyle; Attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions; Timetable. The external factors presented are: Availability of suitable products; Council of the travel
agencies; Information obtained from the destinations, travel agents, and travel media; Recommendation of friends and family; Restrictions on travel
policies (e.g., visa requirement); Health and vaccination requirements at the destinations; Promotions
and special offers; The weather at destination.
The purchase decision process comprises several stages (Blackwell et al., 2006; Reid & Bojanic,
2006) that can be summarized as follows. (i) Recognition of the problem: the different stimuli can

253

trigger consumer awareness of the need or problem. (ii) Search for information: once the need is
high on a conscious level, the model states that
consumers seek information on how to meet this
need. (iii) Evaluation of alternatives: for Kotler
(2000), the consumer demands certain benefits
from the solution offered by the product to satisfy
a need and sees each product as a set of attributes
with different capabilities to provide the advertised
benefits and satisfying the need. (iv) Buying decision: when the consumer decides what to buy and
makes his decision. (v) Postpurchase evaluation:
was the shopping experience up to expectations?
Was it better or worse than he/she expected? These
are some of the questions that consumers give
answers to after going through the experience of a
tourist product purchase. According to Nascimento
(2000), consumer satisfaction is an essential condition for loyalty. The satisfaction results from a positive disconfirmation of consumer expectations (i.e.,
perform higher than expectations) of their desires
and mediated by psychological processes (cognitive, affective, and evaluative). In order to establish
which stage of the presented models is more influenced by the Internet, the following hypotheses
have been formulated.
The first hypothesis (H1) regards the Internet influences the different stages in the purchase decision
process of online touristic products. When deciding
to purchase a good or a service, the consumer goes
through a series of steps: Reid and Bojanic (2006)
proposed a model based on information search an
alternatives evaluation and Blackwell et al. (2006)
made an analysis from the consumer e-commerce
perspective. What is clear is that the Internet is playing a strong role in influencing all these stages and
influencing the decision-making process of the final
consumers (Buhalis & Law, 2008). The decision
process of tourism consumer purchasing is complex
and involves internal and external factors that have
an influence. Therefore, based on the research of
Horner and Swarbrooke (2007), two hypotheses have
been formulated (H2 and H3) and tested through the
rotated component matrix.
H2: The internal factors influence the purchase
decision process of online touristic products.
H3: The external factors influence the purchase
decision process of online touristic products.

254

MARTINS, SALAZAR, AND INVERSINI

Gender is one of the most common forms of segmentation (Kim, Lehto, & Morrison, 2007), and
demographic differences are extremely relevant when
discussing online consumer behavior (Li, Kuo, &
Rusell, 1999), helping marketing managers define
the market segment (Costa & Rita, 2000). Therefore,
the following hypothesis (H4) was formulated and
tested with a t test for means difference.
H4: There are differences in the online purchase
decision based on the characteristics of gender, age, income, residence, occupation, and
qualifications.
The last set of hypotheses regards the perception
of the advantages/disadvantages in the decision purchase process of touristic products and experiences.
These hypotheses are driven by fact that consumers
seem to have gained substantial power within the
tourism value chain (Buhalis & Schertler, 1999),
becoming much more sophisticated than in the past
(Buhalis & Law, 2008).
H5: The Internet brings advantages and limitations
in the purchase decision process of online touristic products for prospective customers.
H6: The Internet brings limitations in the purchase
decision process of online touristic products
for prospective customers.
Methodology
The objectives of this research are to (i) understand the influence of the Internet in the purchase
decision process of online touristic products and
(ii) to understand how the buying behavior of touristic products is influenced by the Internet. The
research was carried out in Portugal due to the
relevance of the tourism industry at the national
level (Turismo de Portugal, 2009) and to the low
rate of Internet adoption (Eurostat, 2012).
A questionnaire was designed to tackle these
hypotheses. It consisted of three parts: (i) introduction of the questionnaire, (ii) a series of closed questions related to the online buying process of touristic
products, and (iii) demographic data. In order to
ensure the validity and reliability of the questionnaire and also to improve its functionality, a pilot
test was developed and administered online to a

sample of 20 people chosen by convenience within
the parameters set for the sample profile. Cronbach’s
alpha was computed, and a value of 0.911 was
obtained, indicating good scale reliability.
The questionnaire was designed in accordance
with the conclusions reached through the literature
review and the research objectives. It was administered through an online survey between January and
March of 2012. The data analysis methods include
descriptive analysis, factor analysis of principal
components, multiple regression analysis, and t test
for means differences. Sampling was done using a
nonprobabilistic sample for convenience, comprising 380 individuals.

Results
Factors That Influence the Online
Purchase Decision Process
In order to reduce the number of factors that
influence the purchase decision process of online
touristic products, we proceeded to an exploratory
analysis of principal components, resulting in five
factors (all with eigenvalues greater than 1), which
explain about 57.7% of the variation, as reported in
Table 1. To obtain a better solution for this analysis,
a rotated component matrix (varimax method) was
computed (Table 1). The items related to the five
factors are indicated.
The first factor was named Convenience and Satisfaction. According to Mowen and Minor (2007)
and Nascimento (2000), customer satisfaction is a
prerequisite for loyalty, and using the Internet consumers can avoid traveling, waiting, and unpleasant sellers. The second factor is labeled Availability.
Kotler’s consumer behavior models state that advertising is a marketing stimulus that influences the
purchase. The third factor is related to Information
and Planning. Consumers have at their fingertips all
the information they need to develop their process
of purchase decision, are increasingly exposed to
a greater flow of information, and the easy access
to information will make the future tourist more
demanding (Dionísio, Rodrigues, Faria, Nunes, &
Lefty, 2009; Turban, McLean, & Wetherbe, 2002;
Vieites and Espiñeira (2008)). The fourth factor was
called Evaluation of Alternatives. The consumer
demands certain benefits from the solution offered

by the product to meet his/her needs (Mowen &
Minor, 2007; Solomon, 2006). The fifth and last
factor highlights the tourists online, labeled Bad
Experience. Borja (2007) and Hoffman and Novak
(1996) state that the mistrust stems from the fact
that the Internet is providing personal data, distrust,
poor visibility, and safety of the product. These
results are indeed coherent with hypotheses H2 and
H3, leading to the conclusion that (H2) the internal
factors influence the purchase decision process of
online touristic products, being associated with convenience and satisfaction, and the external factors
(H3) supported by the availability of suitable products and by the information and planning factor.
Interestingly, regarding both factors and stages
the main advantage of the Internet is the actual
availability (second factor) of the touristic products,

confirming hypothesis H5. The limitations of the
Internet influence the purchase decision process
of online touristic products were also confirmed
through hypothesis H6, on the seventh factor that
highlights the tourists’ online Bad Experience.
The Internet Influence in the Stages of
the Purchase Decision Process
To assess the Internet’s influence on the different
stages of the purchase decision process, a multiple
linear regression was conducted (Table 2), taking
as dependent variable “The Internet is important
in my purchase decision process,” and as independent variables the stages of the buying decisions
process. According to the value of the R2, one can
conclude that 34.9% of the variance is explained by

the model (i.e., the Internet explains about 35% of
the influences in the purchase decision process of
touristic products).
Observing the statistical significances (Sig. <
0.05) of the coefficients related to the model (Table
2), it can be concluded that the Internet is important in two of the stages of the buying decisions of
touristic products—evaluation of alternatives and
purchasing act—supporting hypothesis H1.
Much of the effort during the purchase decision
occurs at the stage where a choice must be made
from the available alternatives (Solomon, 2006).
Studies confirm that it is at this stage that the consumer can compare the products and assess them
in the best way, which is one of the advantages that
the Internet and electronic marketing have to offer
to consumers (Nascimento, 2000), leading to the
purchasing act stage. During this stage the consumers are subjected to powerful promotional stimuli
and feel pressured to decide at the same moment
(Nascimento, 2000).
Average Differences Concerning
Demographic Characteristics
Regarding gender, there are more male respondents (64.5%), confirming that the male gender is
more likely to make purchases online, according to
Wolin and Korgaonkar (2003). In order to assess
the differences concerning the demographic characteristics, we used the t test for mean differences,
having arrived at the following conclusions:

1. Concerning the qualifications, there is a difference in perception between the two levels of
secondary and higher education. Respondents
with higher education give more importance to
the Internet in the purchase decision process of
touristic products.
2. There is also a difference between the individual
monthly average net income from level 1 (less
than 500 €) and level 3 (1,001–1,500 €), where
respondents with an income between 1,001 €
and 1,500 € give more importance to the Internet in the purchase decision process. This results
stems from the actual crises that Portugal is facing, where tourists with a lower income lose
purchase power.
3. Concerning occupation, it was observed that
there is a difference in perception regarding
one variable (The Internet is important during
the stage where I evaluate the available alternatives), showing that students and engineers have
different perceptions.
These results support hypothesis H4, indicating
that there are differences in the decision to purchase
online based on the characteristics of qualifications,
income, and occupation.
Conclusions and Limitations
This study demonstrates the importance that the
Internet has on consumer behavior in the decisionmaking process. The factors that most influence

INTERNET IMPACT ON TRAVEL PURCHASES
this buying behavior process are: convenience and
satisfaction, availability, information and planning,
and evaluation of alternatives. In addition, having
a bad experience on the Internet was found to be
relevant.
The evaluation of alternatives and the purchasing
act itself are the most relevant stages to consumers.
Because so many different online market choices
are offered, companies should focus on disseminating information and increasing the online website
and search engines, leading companies to have a
more in-depth knowledge of consumer preferences.
From a marketing strategy perspective, these companies should invest in adequate prices for the right
audience. This means that consumers will choose
the best value they can find (i.e., the best quality/
price relationship) and this should be the central
message in their communication efforts.
Regarding the average differences with respect
to demographic characteristics, it was founded that
there is no difference in perception between genders, yet qualifications and monthly income showed
that respondents with higher education and higher
income are more influenced by the Internet in the
purchase decision process. This suggests an opportunity to segment and to adjust companies’ offers.
Concerning the limitations of this research and
suggestions for future research, one limitation is
that the variables tested did not fully explain the process of purchase decision process of online touristic
products. It is therefore suggested to conduct further
studies to assess other factors that may also influence consumers of tourist products, thus increasing the number of influencing factors in addition
to those that were revealed in this research, and, by
doing so, increasing also the percentage of explanation of the online consumer behavior. Another limitation relates to the limited degree of generalization
of the results, due to sample size (380 subjects) and
the fact that it is a nonprobabilistic by convenience
sample, so it is suggested a replication of this study
to other samples of consumers. Still, the instrument
of data collection provides a general overview of
the buying process, in relation to the type of buyer
and touristic product. Thus, for future research, it
is recommended the use of questionnaires more
adapted to different market segments, as well as to
particular product classes (such as hotel, flight, or
rent-a-car company). This would allow gathering

257

specific and detailed data, so that the findings and
conclusions would have a higher added value for
business recommendations.
