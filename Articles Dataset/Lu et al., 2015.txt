With the increased market penetration of smartphones and the emergence of high-speed
wireless network technologies, the tourism industry’s interest in using mobile
applications as a means to enhance the tourist experience is rising. However, despite
the growing number of companies and organizations that are investing in travelrelated apps, there is limited academic research on consumers’ intentions to adopt
these technological innovations. In this study, the technology adoption model,
innovation diffusion theory, and social cognitive theory are utilized to investigate the
factors that could affect travel app adoption by tourists visiting rural tourism sites in
China. The results show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and
compatibility are signiﬁcant antecedents of the intention to use travel apps. Further,
self-efﬁcacy indirectly inﬂuences the intention to use travel apps through the
mediation of outcome expectations. The results do not support social norms as
signiﬁcant predictors of behavioural intention. A discussion and implications are also
provided.

Introduction
The uptake of mobile applications (apps), driven by the increasing use of mobile devices
(i.e. smartphones and tablets), is generating unprecedented changes in the operation of
the travel industry and in how people travel. Travel apps refer to mobile apps that are
speciﬁcally targeted at travellers (e.g. Airbnb, Tripadvisor, Skyscanner) as well as those
used in a typical travel context (e.g. Google map, Imoney, Instagram). The increased
variety of travel apps has empowered individuals to access information, make purchases,
and share their experiences anytime and anywhere (Kennedy-Eden & Gretzel, 2012;
Pedrana, 2013). Travel apps have contributed to generating ‘big data’ databases that encompass information related to tourism destinations, business transactions, and tourist behaviours, which can signiﬁcantly improve the management capability of the tourism
industry (Wang, Li, & Li, 2013). Tourism operators are also responding by building
relationships with tourists via travel apps to create more memorable and interactive experiences (Samy, 2012). Despite the promising capacities of travel apps, their adoption is still in
the early stages. According to Trip Advisor, although 60% of travellers have downloaded

travel apps, only 45% of them used the apps for their travel decision-making (Mickaiel,
2011). With increasing numbers of companies and organizations investing in travelrelated apps, consumer acceptance and conﬁdence are becoming vital for ensuring a
better return on investment and increasing the chances of the successful implementation
of the new technology.
To date, there is a dearth of research regarding the adoption of travel apps, although a
number of studies have investigated the adoption of tourism-related electronic commerce
via PC websites (Ayeh, Au, & Law, 2013; Kim, Park, & Morrison, 2008; San Martı́n &
Herrero, 2012). Consumer adoption of mobile apps differs from traditional websites in a
number of ways. First, the cost of using apps is higher than that of using websites. Customers must search in restricted app stores, install the app and wait for it to download, and
sometimes pay for it. Only apps that are truly valuable to consumers and meet their expectations can create initial download and recurring usage patterns (Dickinson et al., 2014;
Localytics, 2014). Therefore, using apps requires a high level of consumer commitment.
Second, consumers tend to have more personal connections with their apps than they do
with websites in that they often personalize their mobile devices with different applications.
Apps also extend the beneﬁts of the related websites by allowing for unique services
enabled by mobile technology to create highly interactive user experiences (Yu, 2013).
Third, smartphones with numerous built-in features (e.g. high-quality camera lenses,
mobile apps, sensors, and projectors) are considered to be more innovative personal computing devices than PCs (Extremetech, 2014). Although the purported beneﬁts of technological innovation may be attractive, researchers and practitioners have found that users
often express less than enthusiastic responses because of their perceived inability to use
the technology (Ellen, Bearden, & Sharma, 1991). For this reason, whether people
believe they possess the adequate knowledge, skills, or ability to use smartphones plays
a vital role in inﬂuencing individual responses to mobile commerce through the use of
apps (Mahat, Ayub, & Wong, 2012; Parasuraman, 2000). As such, these interesting characteristics of mobile app adoption merit further examination (Hopken, Fuchs, Zanker, & Beer,
2010; Wang, Xiang, & Fesenmaier, 2014).
To further examine this phenomenon, we extracted the factors from three closely
related theoretical paradigms, the technology acceptance model (TAM), innovation diffusion theory (IDT), and social cognitive theory (SCT), to form our research framework.
Many of these factors have been identiﬁed in previous studies on technology adoption
and innovation diffusion. The TAM and IDT tend to focus on the characteristics of technology, whereas SCT is more concerned with personal and environmental variables
(Black, Lockett, Winklhofer, & Ennew, 2001; Compeau, Higgins, & Huff, 1999; Mathieson, 1991; Szajna, 1996). By integrating relevant components from these theories, this
study extends previous research by examining the synthesized determinants of travel
mobile apps from the angles of both technology characteristics and users’ social cognitive
factors.
Moreover, our study investigates the perspective of Chinese tourists. Although smartphone penetration is booming in China, published literature examining Chinese consumers
is scarce. By 2014, there were 527 million smartphone users in China (CNNIC, 2014), and
more Chinese than Americans use smartphones as their primary media devices (China
Daily, 2014). It is estimated that the total transaction value of China online travel market
would be RMB 76.92 billion (US$12.52 billion). Majority of online travellers (77%)
would search travel information on mobile devices which indicated there is a huge potential
in tourism mobile commerce (China Internet Watch, 2015). More and more Chinese consumers accept booking travel services (e.g. air ticket, hotel and restaurant reservation,

and scenic attraction ticket) through mobile apps. Apps of China’s leading online travel
enterprises (e.g. Ctrip, Qunar, Tongcheng, Elong, and Tuniu) are the most inﬂuential
ones although each has a particular speciality. For instance, Ctrip specializes in business
travel, where Qunar focuses on independent leisure travel. Tongcheng specializes in
weekend getaways and local sightseeing tickets while Elong focused on hotels and accommodations. Beside these open-platform apps, function-based apps such as social networking apps (e.g. Wechat), restaurant apps (e.g. Dianping), map apps (e.g. Baidu), travel guide
apps e.g. Qyer), taxi and car service apps (e.g. Didi) are also very popular among Chinese
travellers. Thanks to technological advancements, differences in functionality, operations,
and service variety between Chinese and western travel apps are marginal. Both function-based and platform-based Chinese travel apps can easily ﬁnd their western counterparts, such as Tripadvisor, Hipmunk, Triplt, and Instagram. However, although
travellers’ basic needs and wants are similar, their usage behaviours may be signiﬁcantly
affected by their cultures and social environment. Several prior studies have demonstrated
that the process of information technology (IT) adoption varies from culture to culture.
Harris, Rettie, and Cheung (2005) revealed usage and attitude differences of m-commerce
services between consumers in Hong Kong and the UK. Kim, Sohn, and Choi (2011) examined the motivation for and patterns of using social network sites among college students in
the USA and Korea. The ﬁndings suggest that Korean college students put more weight on
social support motivation while US college students emphasize on entertainment motivation. Lee, Chung, and Jung (2015) found that compared to Ireland tourists, South
Korean tourists displayed stronger dependence on social inﬂuence and hedonic characteristics in accepting mobile augmented reality apps. In this vein, there is a need to better
understand country-speciﬁc factors that inﬂuence consumers’ intention to use travel
apps. From the travel destination perspective, the Chinese government launched the
‘Smart Tourism Destination’ initiative in 2009 and designated 2014 ‘the year of smart
tourism’. This initiative aims to integrate and deliver travel information (tourist activities,
tourism products, resource conditions) to tourists, enterprises, and organizations through
end-user internet service systems supported by cloud services and an internet of things
(Gao, 2012; Zhang, 2012). Within the last few years, numerous urban and rural areas in
China have launched ‘smart tourism’ projects in an effort to transform the tourist experience, change destination marketing strategies, and establish destination competitiveness.
Although the technology advancements of this initiative can be readily appreciated, its
market implications have yet to be fully understood. Better understanding of the factors
that affect consumers’ use of mobile apps as travel partners will help to increase the
chances of the success of smart tourism destinations in China.

Literature review
Technology acceptance model
The TAM is a widely used theory that aims to understand technology acceptance and user
behaviour (Davis, 1986; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). Derived from Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1977) theory of reasoned action, the TAM was proposed speciﬁcally to explain computer usage but has since been adopted to explain technology use in various contexts such as
consumers’ online behaviour (Kumar & Mukherjee, 2013) and mobile service usage (Lin,
2011; Pagani, 2004). The TAM posits that user adoption is based on two key beliefs,
namely, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Perceived ease of use refers to the
‘degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort’

J. Lu et al.

(Davis, 1989, p. 320). In contrast, perceived usefulness is related to the ‘degree to which a
person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance’
(Davis, 1989, p. 320). If the technology is easy to use and useful, the user will have a positive
attitude towards it, which will in turn increase the user’s intention to use it.
In the context of IT acceptance within the tourism industry, a small number of studies
have examined the applicability of the TAM. Kim, Lee and Law (2008) investigated the
acceptance behaviour of hotel front ofﬁce systems by using an extended TAM with new
variables such as perceived value, information quality, system quality, and service
quality. Perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were the only variables that had
signiﬁcant effects on actual usage. In a study on travellers’ acceptance of mobile technology, Kim et al. (2008) applied the TAM and found that perceived usefulness and perceived
ease of use inﬂuenced the intention to use mobile devices in tourism contexts. Huh, Kim,
and Law (2009) also investigated employees’ behavioural intentions to use hotel information systems (IS) by evaluating the extent to which dominant models, including the
TAM, the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), and the decomposed TPB, could predict
and explain employee acceptance decision. Their results favoured the TAM for predicting
behavioural intentions. Ayeh et al. (2013) investigated internet users’ intentions to use consumer-generated media for travel planning with an extended TAM model. The results
demonstrated the empirical applicability of the TAM to the context of tourist behaviour.
Based on the above discussion regarding the TAM framework, the following hypotheses
were proposed.
H1. The perceived usefulness of a travel app has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the intention to
use travel apps.
H2. The perceived ease of use of a travel app has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the intention to
use travel apps.

Innovation diffusion theory
IDT has been widely utilized in studies as a primary theory of innovation adoption (Rogers,
1995). According to IDT, innovation refers to a new product, service, idea, practice, technology, structure, or system, and diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system (Rogers,
2003). This deﬁnition of innovation can be applied to tourists’ adoption of new technologies such as travel apps. IDT provides a set of innovation characteristics that may affect
adoption decisions (Agarwal, 2000; Rogers, 1995). These innovation attributes include
relative advantage (the degree to which an innovation can offer an advantage over previous
ways of performing the same task), complexity (the degree to which an innovation is difﬁcult to use and understand), compatibility (the degree to which an innovation is consistent
with the adopter’s existing values, beliefs, experiences and needs), observability (the degree
to which an innovation is visible to others), and trialability (the degree to which an innovation can be experimented with). Relative advantage and complexity are conceptually
overlapped with the TAM’s perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (reversed),
respectively (Dillon & Morris, 1996). Among these innovation attributes, relative advantage, complexity, and compatibility have been found to be the most frequently identiﬁed
factors for the adoption and diffusion of IT innovations (Dillon & Morris, 1996; Papies
& Clement, 2008; Vijayasarathy, 2004). Relative advantage attracts users to adopt technology to gain a better image and better value. The extent of prior experience with similar technologies (i.e. compatibility) eases users’ nervousness about adopting new ones, and

1063

previous studies have consistently found that both perceived relative advantage and compatibility have signiﬁcantly positive effects on the intention to use technologies (Carter
& Bélanger, 2005; Chen, Park, & Putzer, 2010; Esty & Winston, 2009). However, the
less complex the technology, the more likely an individual is to accept it. Hence, complexity
may negatively affect the user’s intention to use the technology, as evidenced in many
empirical studies (Hobday, 1998; Lin & Ho, 2011; Mukherjee & Hoyer, 2001).
IDT has also been employed to investigate and explain tourism innovations (Hjalager,
2010). Smerecnik and Andersen (2011) examined the determinants and driving forces for
the diffusion of environmental sustainability innovations in hotels and ski resorts, and complexity was found to be most strongly associated with the adoption of sustainable innovation. Information and communication technology implementation in tourism
organizations has been a main focus of tourism innovation diffusion. Hung, Yang, Yang,
and Chuang (2011) examined factors that affected the adoption of online trading systems
by travel agencies in Taiwan. Among the three innovation attributes included in their
study (compatibility, relative advantage, and relative risk), only compatibility affected
the adoption decision. As such, according to IDT, relative advantage, complexity, and compatibility will be used in this study. Because both relative advantages and complexity were
captured by the TAM and presented in Hypotheses 1 and 2, only comparability was predicted in this study to be a signiﬁcant precursor to travel app adoption.
H3. Perceived compatibility has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the intention to use travel apps.

Social cognitive theory
SCT, which stems from social learning theory, has been recognized as a comprehensive
theoretical framework for analysing human behaviour (Bandura, 1986). According to the
SCT, human actions are a product of triadic, dynamic, and reciprocal interactions
between personal, behavioural, and environmental factors (Bandura, 1986). Through the
interactions among these determinants, people demonstrate capacities that separate
humans from other living beings, such as forethought, self-reactivity, and self-reﬂection
(Bandura, 2001). Through the exercise of forethought, people anticipate the outcomes of
prospective actions and select the courses of action that are likely to produce the desired
outcomes. Self-reactivity capacity involves monitoring and regulating behaviour patterns
by comparing with personal goals and standards. Self-reﬂection is related to people’s retrospective assessments of their capacities to exercise control over their actions through indicators of reality. Although it has remained an underutilized theory in tourism marketing
research, SCT has been widely applied in the IS literature, with demonstrated validity
(Chiu, Hsu, & Wang, 2006; Compeau et al., 1999; Khang, Han, & Ki, 2014; LaRose &
Eastin, 2004; Wang & Wu, 2008). As Bandura (2001) suggested, the relative importance
of personal, behavioural, and environmental inﬂuences vary for different activities and
under different circumstances. Thus, examining the applicability of SCT to travel app
usage is merited, and three core constructs from SCT are included in this study: outcome
expectation, self-efﬁcacy, and social inﬂuence.
Outcome expectations
According to SCT, self-regulatory systems mediate external inﬂuences and provide a basis
for purposeful action (Bandura, 2001). One important factor in self-regulation is people’s
outcome expectations of an action. Outcome expectations are constructed through a

Downloaded by [Zhejiang University] at 20:10 20 September 2015

1064

J. Lu et al.

person’s forethought, which involves ‘observed conditional relations between environmental events in the world around them, and the outcomes given actions produce’
(Bandura, 2001). People anticipate the likely consequences of their prospective actions
and more readily adopt actions that are likely to produce their desired outcomes rather
than actions that might bring unrewarding or negative outcomes (Bandura, 2001; Lee,
Kim, & Kim, 2012). Compeau et al. (1999) provided conﬁrmation that outcome expectations impact individuals’ adoption of computing technology. They further divided
outcome expectations into two categories: performance (improvements in job performance)
and personal (changes in image or status or achieving a sense of accomplishment) and
found that performance outcome expectations had more inﬂuence than personal outcome
expectations. Lin and Hsu (2013) also identiﬁed the two types of outcome expectations
when predicting green consumer behaviour. They found that personal outcome expectations
served as positive antecedents, but performance outcome expectations did not. The
expected outcomes maybe categorized into different types of incentives that motivate
human behaviour (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1992). For instance, LaRose and Eastin
(2004) identiﬁed ﬁve types of outcomes of internet use: social, activity, monetary, self-reactive, and status. Examining music downloading behaviour, LaRose and Kim (2006) focused
on social, novelty-seeking, and economic outcomes and found signiﬁcant links between
outcome expectations and behavioural intentions.
The outcome expectations of travel apps have been explored indirectly in a number of
studies. For instance, Dickinson et al. (2014) summarized ﬁve main capacities of travel
apps: information, two-way sharing, context awareness, an internet of things, and
tagging. Kennedy-Eden and Gretzel (2012) proposed seven service-based functions (navigation, social, mobile marketing, security, transaction, information, and entertainment) and
seven customization-based functions (personal preferences, location, security, web access,
content addition, aesthetic changes, and the same for all). These studies provide important
insights into performance outcome expectations related to travel app adoption. However,
little research has studied personal outcome expectations for travel app adoption. In
addition, no studies have investigated the relationship between outcome expectations and
the intention to use travel apps. In accordance with the theoretical proposition, individuals
are more likely to use travel apps if they believe that doing so will result in valued outcomes
such as economic beneﬁts, efﬁciency, prestige, or socialization. The expected outcomes
from using travel apps might therefore be an important predictor of travel app use intentions, which give rise to the following hypotheses.
H4: Performance outcome expectations of travel apps have a positive effect on behavioural
intention to use travel apps.
H5. Personal outcome expectations of travel apps have a positive effect on behavioural intention to use travel apps.

Self-efﬁcacy
As a central construct of SCT, self-efﬁcacy relates to a person’s perceived ability to perform
a speciﬁc behaviour (Bandura, 1986). It does not emphasize an individual’s actual skills but
instead hinges on the degree of the person’s conﬁdence in being able to complete a task
using those skills (Shu, Tu, & Wang, 2011). As a key self-evaluative technique that
serves as the foundation of human behavioural change, self-efﬁcacy inﬂuences people’s
decisions on the level of effort to invest in a task and how long to persevere in the face
of obstacles (Bandura, 2001, 2012). People with high self-efﬁcacy are more likely to

Current Issues in Tourism

1065

Downloaded by [Zhejiang University] at 20:10 20 September 2015

view difﬁcult tasks as obstacles to be mastered rather than avoided. Previous research has
demonstrated a signiﬁcant link between self-efﬁcacy and a variety of behaviours. For
examples, Hsu and Chiu (2004) found internet self-efﬁcacy to be a potentially important
driver of people’s efforts to use e-services. Ratten (2013) examined computer self-efﬁcacy
as a positive predictor of behavioural intentions towards cloud computing. The concept of
smartphone efﬁcacy has recently been utilized in empirical studies. For instance, Okumus
and Bilgihan (2014) revealed that smartphone self-efﬁcacy served as an immediate antecedent of the intention to use restaurant apps to order food. Chen et al. (2010) reported that
self-efﬁcacy had a direct positive inﬂuence on the healthcare professionals’ intentions to use
a smartphone to deliver healthcare services. Hong, Hwang, Tai, and Chen (2014) investigated the impact of smartphone self-efﬁcacy on English learning anxiety and judgement
using an app. The results demonstrated that smartphone self-efﬁcacy was a signiﬁcant predictor. Thus, the next hypothesis is as follows.
H6: Smartphone self-efﬁcacy has a positive effect on behavioural intention to use travel apps.

SCT further notes that the outcome expectations for a particular behaviour are meaningless
if the user feels unable to execute it successfully (Badura, 1997). That is, self-efﬁcacy
beliefs shape people’s expected outcomes from their efforts, which in turn affect their behaviour. LaRose and Eastin (2004) found that outcome expectations served as partial
mediators between self-efﬁcacy and internet use. In the context of knowledge system
usage, Lin and Huang (2008) also conﬁrmed that self-efﬁcacy inﬂuenced usage not only
directly but also indirectly through performance and personal outcome expectations. In
accordance with SCT’s theoretical proposition, smartphone self-efﬁcacy should be a precursor to the outcome expectations of using apps. As smartphone users become more
self-efﬁcacious, their expectations of obtaining speciﬁc outcomes from using travel apps
also increase, which encourages the increased use of travel apps. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses.
H7: Smartphone self-efﬁcacy will lead to higher performance outcome expectations from travel
apps.
H8. Smartphone self-efﬁcacy will lead to higher personal outcome expectations from travel
apps.

Social norms
According to SCT, the environment is one of the key factors that affects a person’s behaviour, and one’s social environment is a crucial component of this factor. Personal behavioural change occurs within a network of social inﬂuences, including social norms and the
behaviour of the people in one’s immediate environment, such as parents, friends, and community members (Bandura, 1986, 1997). When technology is relatively new, individuals
may lack sufﬁcient knowledge or information to form feelings about it (Sawang, Sun, &
Salim, 2014). As a result, behavioural intention can be inﬂuenced greatly by the opinions
of signiﬁcant others (Thompson, Higgins, & Howell, 1994). Social norms explain emerging
technology adoption in various contexts to a great degree. For instance, Kleijnen, Wetzels,
and de Ruyter (2004) reported the positive inﬂuence of social norms on mobile ﬁnance
service adoption. Glegg et al. (2013) found that social inﬂuences were the primary facilitators for therapists’ adoption of virtual reality for brain injury rehabilitation. It should be
noted that social norms play stronger behavioural roles in collectivistic societies such as

1066

J. Lu et al.

China (Traﬁmow, Triandis, & Goto, 1991) than in individualistic societies. Chinese people
tend to focus on the goals of the group to which they belong, ﬁtting in with others, and
appreciating commonalities with others (Bagozzi, Wong, Abe, & Bergami, 2000). Collective values can inﬂuence individuals’ needs to identify with others or to enhance their image
by conforming to others’ expectations regarding the use of travel apps. Thus, we hypothesize the following.
H9. Social norms will lead to higher behavioural intention to use travel apps.

The research model
In keeping with the preceding discussion, the purpose of this study was to identify signiﬁcant factors that affected the adoption of travel apps. Utilizing the TAM, IDT, and SCT as
the theoretical background, we propose the research model shown in Figure 1.

Methodology
Data collection
The data were collected using a ﬁeld intercept survey in China from March to April 2014.
Seven rural tourism sites (Shangougou Village, Shuikou Village, Wuzhen, Meijiangwu
Village, Qiaodao Lake, Donghaitang Village, Gaoyou Village) in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Province were selected as study sites. These sites were selected not only because they were
representative of rural tourism sites in China (i.e. water-based, mountain-based, forestbased, home-inn cluster) but also for their convenient access by the ﬁeld research team. Systematic random sampling was employed, and the survey questionnaire was distributed to
every ﬁfth tourist at the gate when they entered the sites. Adult tourists who used smartphones were eligible for this study. One thousand questionnaires were distributed, and
684 questionnaires were returned originally. Through data screening, 71 responses were
removed because of incomplete answers or missing variables, resulting in a ﬁnal sample
of 613 participants, an effective response rate of 61.3%.

Survey instruments
At the beginning of the questionnaire, a deﬁnition of travel apps along with examples was
provided to participants. We broadly deﬁned travel apps as mobile apps that serve the needs
of travellers at different stages from pre-travel, during-travel to post-travel. Examples provided include popular travel apps in China such as Ctrip, Qunar, Tongcheng, Gaode map,
and Dianping. The participants are adequately familiar with travel apps and most of them
have used travel apps before. The survey items were adapted from the related literature, and
the appendix lists the items. All of the items were measured using a ﬁve-point Likert scale,
with the anchors being ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘strongly agree.’ The intention to use travel
apps was measured using a three-item scale adapted from Ajzen and Fishbein (1977) and
Bock and Kim (2002). Terms such as likely, need, and want were used to assess tourists’
intentions to use mobile apps. The questions for the TAM and IDT constructs (i.e. perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived compatibility) were taken from previously
validated inventories (Davis et al., 1989; Moore & Benbasat, 1991) and modiﬁed to ﬁt the
travel app context. The items that measured self-efﬁcacy were developed based on Okumus
and Bilgihan’s (2014) smartphone self-efﬁcacy measures. We modiﬁed two items from Hsu
and Chiu (2004) to measure social norms and found that very few studies had explicitly
measured performance outcome expectations of travel apps that targeted rural travel. Ultimately, 22 items were developed for this construct that addressed seven main functions of
travel apps based on the work of Kennedy-Eden and Gretzel (2012): information, navigation, safety, transactions, social, entertainment, and marketing. The measurements for personal outcome expectations were adapted from Bock and Kim’s (2002) scale, which
includes two sub-dimensions: self-expression and self-accomplishment. We also included
common demographic measures such as gender, age, education level, and personal
income level. A pretest of the questionnaire with all of the construct measures was performed with 50 subjects for a pilot study. The Cronbach’s a values ranged from 0.65 to
0.93, exceeding the commonly required acceptable reliability level for explanatory research
(Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). In addition, comments collected from experts led to a
number of minor modiﬁcations to the questionnaire’s wording, and suggestions from
reviewers were also incorporated in the revised instrument.

Data analysis
The research model was analysed by structural equation modelling using Analysis of
Moment Structures. The data analysis utilized a two-step approach as recommended by
Anderson and Gerbing (1988). The ﬁrst step involves the analysis of the measurement
model and the second step tests the structural relationships among latent constructs.

Results
The demographic proﬁle of the respondents is summarized in Table 1. The participants for
this study were 49.1% male and 50.9% female, ranging in age from 19 to 65 yrs, with a
mean age of 36 yrs. The majority of the respondents (71%) had received an undergraduate
degree. Nearly half of the respondents had a monthly personal income greater than RMB
3000.
The study constructs were tested for common factors using principal component analysis. The results shows that each construct’s Kaiser – Meyer – Olkin (KMO) value was greater
than 0.8 (p ¼ .000), suggesting an adequate sample size for factor analysis. Items with

highly correlated error variance and items that loaded poorly onto their unique factors were
removed. The factor analyses revealed that all of the main constructs except for performance outcome expectations were unidimensional (Table 2 and Table 3). Six factors were
identiﬁed for performance outcome expectations: information, interaction, transactions,
navigation, marketing, and entertainment (the safety dimension was merged with navigation). Item parcelling (sum of items) was used to create aggregate items of each factor as
manifest variables (Little, Cunningham, & Shahar, 2002). Descriptive statistics of the
items that remained in the measurement model are shown in Table 2.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to assess the data ﬁt of the measurement model. Model estimation was performed using maximum likelihood, with the item
correlation matrix as the input. For a measurement model to have sufﬁciently good ﬁt,
the chi-squared value normalized by degrees of freedom (x2/df) should not exceed 5,
and the non-normed ﬁt index (NNFI) and comparative ﬁt index (CFI) values should
exceed 0.9. For the current CFA model, the x2/df was 1.96 (x2 ¼ 1194; df ¼ 610),
NNFI was 0.93, and CFI was 0.94, suggesting adequate model ﬁt.
Evaluating the reliability and validity of a research model includes estimating the
internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity of the construct items
(Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Table 2 shows that all of the composite reliabilities were well
above the recommended level of 0.70, indicating adequate internal consistency. The indicator loadings exceeded the suggested criterion of 0.50 on their associated factors, which
demonstrated the convergent validity in the construct. In addition, convergent validity is
considered adequate when all constructs have an average variance extracted (AVE) over
0.50. The AVE of the study constructs ranged from 0.61 to 1.00. Satisfactory discriminant
validity can be veriﬁed when the AVE from the construct is greater than the squared correlations among the model constructs. As shown in Table 4, the test results of discriminant
validities of the scales are satisfactory.
A full structural model with all parameter estimates was then computed using the modiﬁed model depicted in Figure 2. Given the lack of prior research examining the causal
relationship among the variables, modiﬁcations to the hypothesized model were considered
to improve the ﬁt. Only modiﬁcations that were consistent with theory and/or prior research

suggested six additional possible paths that could improve the model ﬁt. Of these, one
path met the criterion of being consistent with theory and/or prior research, that is, the
path from advantage to compatibility, and a moderate, positive relationship between
these variables has been previously reported (Schierz, Schilke, & Wirtz, 2010; Wu &

The parameter estimates consisted of three aspects: (1) the CFIs, which indicate the
model’s goodness of ﬁt, (2) the path coefﬁcients, which represent the strength of the
relationship between the independent and dependent variables, and (3) the R2 value,
which indicates the amount of variance explained by the model (Hsu & Chiu, 2004).

GFI ¼ 0.91, CFI ¼ 0.93, root mean square residual ¼ 0.07, and root mean square error of
approximation ¼ 0.05. Seven of the hypothesized relationships were signiﬁcant. Perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use and compatibility had positive effects on intention, with
path coefﬁcients of 0.49, 0.12, and 0.10. Thus, Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 were supported. Performance outcome expectations and personal outcome expectations contributed signiﬁcantly to intention, with path coefﬁcients of 0.43 and 0.15, respectively. Hypotheses 4
and 5 were supported. The path from self-efﬁcacy to intention was insigniﬁcant, and
thus, Hypothesis 6 was rejected. Corresponding to Hypotheses 7 and 8, self-efﬁcacy had
positive effects on performance and personal outcome expectations, with path coefﬁcients
of 0.56 and 0.62. As we also see, social norms had no signiﬁcant effect on intention, and
thus Hypothesis 9 was rejected. In total, the model explained 53% of the variance in the
intention to use apps in rural tourism.

Discussion
By integrating inﬂuential determinants from three relevant theories, that is, the TAM, IDT,
and SCT, this current research proposed and validated a research model that was designed to
enrich our understanding of the predictors of mobile app use among tourists. The results
show that a signiﬁcant amount of variance in the behavioural intention to use apps was
explained by the model’s independent variables. The three app attributes, namely, perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use and compatibility, were found to have signiﬁcant effects
on the behavioural intention to use apps, which conﬁrmed the validity of the TAM and IDT
in explaining app use intention in the context of rural tourism. This ﬁnding suggests that app
developers should provide sufﬁcient and accurate information through complete online
content management system to enhance the perceived usefulness by travellers. User interface design needs to be simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate. Self-monitoring features
could be incorporated in the design of apps. This approach will enable app developers to
continuously improve their apps based on actual use.

Among the three variables from TAM and IDT, compatibility played the most important
role in encouraging rural travel app use intentions. This result accords with previous
research that showed perceived compatibility was the best perception-based indicator of
attitude towards IT adoption (Meuter, Ostrom, Bitner, & Roundtree, 2003; Vijayasarathy,
2004). This ﬁnding can be interpreted from multiple perspectives. From the technology perspective, because mobile devices have been integrated into every aspect of our lives, the use
of mobile apps to enhance travel experience is more compatible with our habitual mind-set,
which can contribute to sustained habitual or automatic behaviour (Verplanken & Aarts,
1999). From the experiential perspective, rural tourists desire to be in nature, escape
urban life, and be connected with the outdoors, which may increase the incompatibility
with spending their vacation time using modern technology. To eradicate tourists’
worries about the incompatibility of technology and nature, it is important for app developers to incorporate nature-inspired design and marketing techniques to reconcile these two
different elements. Further, from the tourism development perspective, rural tourism destinations in China have lagged behind urban destinations in terms of mobile commerce.
Although many rural tourists were interested in using apps to facilitate their travelling,
they were often frustrated by the lack of wireless internet infrastructures or the lack of relevant apps. This ﬁnding highlights the urgent need for developing rural tourism strategies
based on the use of mobile technology. For instance, it is suggested to establish centralized
tourism databases and appropriate operational systems to collect, store, exchange, and
release tourism data; develop wireless internet infrastructures (i.e. Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G) for creating mobile business environment; launch smart tourism service platforms (websites, apps,
and digital screens) to enhance tourist experience and destination image; and install vending
machines and QR code readers in stations, terminals, hotels, restaurants, and tourism sites to
facilitate the adoption of mobile technology in tourism process.
In terms of the social cognitive determinants of travel app use, the ﬁndings also showed
that outcome expectations are important motivational determinants of behaviour, which
supports the propositions derived from SCT (Bandura, 2001). More precisely, performance
outcome expectations serve as a more powerful predictor than personal outcome expectations. This ﬁnding suggests that extrinsic motivations may play a more important role
in travel app adoption. Referring to speciﬁc functional expectancy subcategories, the
results showed that tourists have high expectations for transaction functions (mean .
4.5). They had moderate expectations for information, navigation, marketing, social interaction, and entertainment functions (3.5 , mean , 4.5). Due to the fact that rural tourism
operators have been slow to embrace e-commerce, ‘pay upfront’ has been the main payment
approach of their services. With the growing popularity for prepaid tourism services, such
as groupon, last minute deal, fuzzy reservation, and bidding, the transaction function of
travel apps has become increasingly important. This calls for more attention to developing
transaction platforms and booking services in mobile commerce to provide more signiﬁcant
value to tourists. Compared with urban tourism, rural tourism in China involves a larger
number of independent hotels that are incapable of direct online sales. Working with
third-party booking apps can be an effective way for them to increase business and
become more competitive. In addition, tourists have rated all app functions above 3.5,
suggesting that travel apps covering all aspects of the journey may have a greater potential
to attract users. Additionally, marketing efforts are warranted to promote the performance
and personal values of using travel apps, for example, enriching the travel experience and
demonstrating a certain lifestyle.
Chinese tourists who assess themselves as being highly efﬁcacious tend to look for
more rewards from travel app use than tourists with little belief in their ability to use

smartphones. This ﬁnding is consistent with technology adoption studies conducted in the
Western context (Okumus & Bilgihan, 2014). It implies that smartphone self-efﬁcacy in
addition to expectation beliefs should be considered a critical component in travel app
design. Thanks to the mass production of low-cost smartphones by domestic mobile manufacturers, China’s smartphone users are growing rapidly. In the current study, participants
reported high levels of smart phone self-efﬁcacy, which suggests that Chinese tourists are
ready to embrace mobile apps as an integral part of their travel experience. Therefore, travel
apps have great potential to transform and revolutionize the tourism industry in China. On
the other hand, while mobile technology becomes more and more pervasive worldwide, an
age-related under-utilization still exists (Agarwal, Animesh, & Prasad, 2009). Sufﬁcient
support and necessary learning aids should be considered to enhance senior tourists’ smartphone self-efﬁcacy, which can be critical for promoting app use.
Contrary to our expectations, social norms did not have a signiﬁcant impact on app use
intentions. This result is similar to the ﬁnding by San Martı́n and Herrero (2012) that social
norms are not a signiﬁcant predictor of online purchase intentions in rural tourism. One
possible explanation is that rural travel apps are still new, and thus people have limited
awareness of their signiﬁcant others or peers using them. As such, the inﬂuence of social
norms on the behavioural intention to use rural travel apps is negligible. It is also possible
that social norms may have a moderating (i.e. buffering the impact of self-efﬁcacy and
outcome expectations on behavioural intention) rather than direct (self-efﬁcacy, outcome
expectations, and social norm functions in parallel relationships) effect. In a study of individual technology adoption, Sawang et al. (2014) found a critical moderating role of social
inﬂuence on the collectivistic culture in the relationship between attitude, perceived behavioural control, and IT adoption.
Conclusions
Mobile applications’ unique characteristics of convenience, personalization, and empowerment make them an important marketing channel for tourism. However, little is known
about the underlying mechanism of consumers’ intentions to use this technology. This
study represents an initial attempt to understand the mechanism by which social cognitive
factors and technology characteristics inﬂuence tourists’ intentions to use mobile apps. The
results of this study provide important implications for both researchers and practitioners.
For researchers, this study provides a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of
what drives the adoption of mobile technology by proposing an integrative approach to predicting behavioural intentions towards travel apps. This research model could be adapted to
different mobile service categories to further identify the differences in perceptions and attitudes. For tourism organizations and individual practitioners, understanding the key constructs in the proposed research model is crucial to more effectively design and
implement mobile travel services that yield high consumer acceptance. Vast sums of
capital have been invested in novel and untested technologies such as mobile apps to
improve the delivery of tourism services. However, many programmes are not readily
embraced by end users. Thus, studies that examine which factors are beneﬁcial or detrimental towards the acceptance of emerging technologies may prove particularly valuable.
It is important to evaluate our study in light of its limitations. First, our analysis of crosssectional data prevents causal inferences. Although the SEM analyses imply that the
variance in the dependent variable is explained by its antecedents, we could have easily analysed the opposite causal sequence as well. A longitudinal survey or experimental design
could clarify causation. Another concern lies in the fact that the ﬁndings were solely

1074

based on a sample of Chinese tourists. More well-designed studies are warranted to further
examine potential differences in user needs from travel apps across different groupings and
cultures. Further, the factor loadings of a number of items on the functional outcome scale
fell below the 0.70 threshold, indicating that the scale should be further validated in future
studies. Finally, other social cognitive factors should be considered to improve the current
model, such as risk perception and self-regulation.
