# Keywords-Extractor
The python program extractor.py extracts the keywords from our dataset of research papers. It does so by removing stopwrods, normalising the text by expanding combined words (such as "doesn't", "hasn't", "can't") etc. It then splits the documents into words, and calculates the TF-IDF score for each word. After this, the words with the highest scores are filtered out and treated as keywords i.e. our output.
